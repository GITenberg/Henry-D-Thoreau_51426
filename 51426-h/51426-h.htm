<p>When, in 1879, I was asked by my friend
Charles Dudley Warner to write the biography
of Thoreau which follows, I was by
no means unprepared. I had known this
man of genius for the last seven years of his
too short life; had lived in his family, and
in the house of his neighbor across the way,
Ellery Channing, his most intimate friend
outside of that family; and had assisted
Channing in the preparation and publication
of his "Thoreau, the Poet-Naturalist,"&mdash;the
first full biography which appeared. Not
very long after Thoreau's death Channing
had written me these sentences, with that insight
of the future which he often displayed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"That justice can be done to our deceased
brother by me, of course I do not think. But to
you and to me is intrusted the care of his immediate
fame. I feel that my part is not yet done,
and cannot be without your aid. My little sketch
must only serve as a note and advertisement that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
such a man lived,&mdash;that he did brave work,
which must yet be given to the world. In the
midst of all the cold and selfish men who knew
this brave and devoted scholar and genius, why
should not you be called on to make some sacrifices,
even if it be to publish my sketch?"</p></div>

<p>This I was ready to do in 1864; and it
was through my means that the volume, then
much enlarged by Channing, was published
in 1873, and again, with additions and corrections,
in 1902.</p>

<p>I had also the great advantage of hearing
from the mother and sister of Henry the affectionate
side of his domestic life,&mdash;which
indeed I had witnessed, both in his health
and in his long mortal illness. From Emerson,
who had a clear view of Thoreau's intellect
and his moral nature, I derived many
useful suggestions, though not wholly agreeing
with him in some of his opinions. In
March, 1878, after hearing Emerson read a
few unpublished notes on Thoreau, made
years before, I called on him one evening,
and thus entered the event in my journal:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I was shown several of Thoreau's early papers;
one a commentary on Emerson's 'Sphinx,'
and another from his own translation of 'The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
Seven Against Thebes,' written at William Emerson's
house on Staten Island in 1843. Of this
episode in Thoreau's life (his tutorship for six
months of William Emerson's three sons), Emerson
told me that his brother and Henry were not
men that could get along together: 'each would
think whatever the other did was out of place.'
This was said to imply that Thoreau's poem 'The
Departure' could not have been written on his
leaving Castleton in Staten Island. I had shown
Emerson these verses (first printed by me, at
Sophia Thoreau's wish, in the Boston 'Commonwealth'
of 1863), whereupon he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think Thoreau had always looked forward
to authorship as his work in life, and finding that
he could write prose well, he soon gave up writing
verse, in which he was not willing to be patient
enough to make the lines smooth and flowing.
These verses are smoother than he usually wrote;
but I have now no recollection of seeing them before,
nor of any circumstances in which they may
have been written.' Alluding to Judge Hoar's
marked dislike of Thoreau, Emerson said, 'There
was no <em>bow</em> in Henry; he never sought to please
his hearers or his friends.' Thomas Cholmondeley,
the nephew of Scott's friend Richard Heber,
meeting Henry at dinner at Emerson's, to whom
Cholmondeley had letters in 1854, and expressing
to his host the wish to see more of him, Emerson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
said he told the Englishman, 'If you wish to see
Thoreau, go and board at his mother's house; she
will be glad to take you in, and there you can meet
him every day. He did so,' added Emerson,
'and you know the result.' ... This led to further
mention of Mrs. Thoreau, who, Emerson said,
'was a person of sharp and malicious wit,' of
whose sayings he read me some instances from
his Journals. Among these was her remark to
Mrs. Emerson, 'Henry is very <em>tolerant</em>'; adding
'Mr. Emerson has been talking so much with
Henry that he has learnt Henry's way of thinking
and talking.' Emerson went on to me:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I had known Henry slightly when in college;
the scholarship from which he drew an income
while there (a farm at Pullen Point in Chelsea)
was the one that I and my brothers, William and
Edward, had enjoyed while we were at college.
But my first intimate acquaintance with Henry
began after his graduation in 1837. Mrs. Brown,
my wife's sister, who then boarded with the Thoreau
family in the Parkman house, where the Library
now stands, used to bring me his verses
(the "Sic Vita" and others), and tell me of his
entries in his Journal. Here is the Index to my
Journals, in which Thoreau's name appears perhaps
fifty times, perhaps more.'"</p></div>

<p>Thus far my Journal of 1878.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span></p>

<p>I was myself introduced to Thoreau by
Emerson, March 28, 1855, in the Concord
Town Hall, one evening, just before a lecture
there by Emerson. From that time until
Henry's death, May 6, 1862, I saw him
every few days, unless he or I was away from
Concord, and for more than two years I dined
with him daily at his mother's table, in the
house opposite to Ellery Channing's. I thus
came to know all the surviving members of
his kindred,&mdash;his eccentric uncle, Charles
Dunbar, his two aunts on each side, Jane
and Maria Thoreau, and Louisa and Sophia
Dunbar (both older than Mrs. Thoreau), and
the descendants in Maine of his aunt Mrs.
Billings, long since dead. His sister Helen
and his brother John I never knew, but
learned much about them from their mother
and sister; for neither Henry nor his father
often spoke of them. Sophia also placed in
my hands after Henry's death several of his
poems, which I printed in the "Commonwealth,"
and Emerson gave me other manuscripts
of Thoreau which had lodged with
him while he was editing the "Dial." He
had urged Sophia to leave all the MSS. with
me, but her pique against Channing at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
time prevented this,&mdash;she knowing him to
be intimate with me.</p>

<p>With all this preparation, I received from
Mr. Blake, to whom Sophia had bequeathed
them in 1876, the correspondence of Thoreau
and his college essays, with some other papers
of Henry's and his own, but without the
replies from the family to Henry's affectionate
letters. Even his own to his mother and
sisters had been withheld from publication
by Emerson in 1865, when a small collection
of Thoreau's Letters and Poems was edited
by Emerson. This omission Sophia regretted,
as she told me; and finding them now in
my hands, though I made use of their contents
in writing the biography, I withheld
them from full publication, foreseeing that I
should probably have occasion to edit the
letters in full at some later time; and I made
but sparing use of the early essays.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I perceived that the
character and genius of Thoreau could not be
well understood unless some knowledge was
had of the Concord farmers, scholars, and citizens,
among whom he had spent his days, and
who have furnished a background for that
scene of authorship which the small town of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
Concord has presented for now more than seventy
years. Therefore, having access to the records
and biographies of the Concord "Social
Circle," then in preparation for the public,
and to many other records of the past in New
England, I sketched therefrom the character
of our interesting community, which gave
color and tone to the outlines of this thoughtful
scholar's career. But I held back for the
"Familiar Letters" the more intimate details
of Thoreau's self-devoted life, and did not
draw heavily on the thirty-odd volumes of
the Journals, to which, at Worcester, Mr.
Blake gave me free access. It was then his
purpose to bring out these Journals much
earlier and more fully than was done, until
Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co. published
their admirable edition in fourteen volumes,
a few years ago, after Mr. Blake's death.</p>

<p>The success of my biography, written under
these limitations, has more than justified
reasonable expectations. It was popular
from the first, and is still widely read, and
called for by a generation of readers quite
distinct from those for whom it was originally
written. Since the spring of 1882, when it
was published, many details of Thoreau's life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
and that of his ancestors have become known
by an examination of his copious manuscripts,
of the papers of his Loyalist ancestors, and
his father's relatives in the island of Jersey;
and by the publication of some twenty-five
volumes from Thoreau's own hand. He
never employed an amanuensis, and he seems
to have carefully preserved the large mass of
his manuscripts which accumulated during
his literary life of some twenty-five years.
The exceptions to this remark were the copies
of his earlier verses, which he told me, in
his last illness, he had destroyed, because
they did not meet Emerson's approval, and
those pages of his Journals which he had
issued in printed books or magazine articles.
Fragments of his youthful verses were kept,
however, by some of his family, and still
exist. From all these sources many things
have come to light concerning his ancestry
and the minor events of his life, which I hope
eventually to give the world in a final biography
that will serve as a sequel to this one.
The greatly enhanced reputation which Thoreau
now enjoys, as compared with his fame
in 1882, seems to warrant a detail which was
not then needful, and which even the "Familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
Letters" does not furnish. Much misconception
of his character and the facts of
his life still prevails; and singular statements
have been made in text-books, as to his origin
and training. One authority described Thoreau
as descended from "farmer folk" in
Connecticut, who were recent immigrants
from France. So far as I know, not a single
ancestor of his ever dwelt in Connecticut;
they were all merchants; and though his
Thoreau ancestors spoke French, or a patois
of it, in Jersey, there is no evidence that any
of them had lived in France for more than
five centuries.</p>

<p>This initial authentic biography, with its
few errors corrected, now comes forth in a
new edition, which will long be found useful,
in the manner indicated, and I hope, may be
received as the earlier edition has been, with
all the favor which its modest aim deserves.</p>

BIRTH AND FAMILY.</h2>


<p>There died in a city of Maine, on the
river Penobscot, late in the year 1881, the
last member of a family which had been
planted in New England a little more than
a hundred years before, by a young tradesman
from the English island of Jersey, and
had here produced one of the most characteristic
American and New English men of
genius whom the world has yet seen. This
lady, Miss Maria Thoreau, was the last
child of John Thoreau, the son of Philip
Thoreau and his wife, Marie le Galais, who,
a hundred years ago, lived in the parish of
St. Helier, in Jersey. This John Thoreau
was born in that parish, and baptized there
in the Anglican church, in April, 1754; he
emigrated to New England about 1773,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
and in 1781 married in Boston Miss Jane
Burns, the daughter of a Scotchman of
some estate in the neighborhood of Stirling
Castle, who had emigrated earlier to Massachusetts,
and had here married Sarah
Orrok, the daughter of David Orrok, a Massachusetts
Quaker. Jane (Burns) Thoreau,
the granddaughter of David Orrok, and the
grandmother of Henry David Thoreau, died
in Boston, in 1796, at the age of forty-two.
Her husband, John Thoreau, Sr., removed
from Boston to Concord, in 1800, lived in a
house on the village square, and died there
in 1801. His mother, Marie le Galais, outlived
him a few weeks, dying at St. Helier,
in 1801. Maria Thoreau, granddaughter
and namesake of Marie le Galais, died in
December, 1881, in Bangor, Maine.</p>

<p>From the recollections of this "aunt
Maria," who outlived all her American relatives
by the name of Thoreau, Henry
Thoreau derived what information he possessed
concerning his Jersey ancestors. In
his journal for April 21, 1855, he makes
this entry:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Aunt Maria has put into my hands to-day
for safe-keeping three letters from Peter Thoreau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
(her uncle), directed to 'Miss Elizabeth Thoreau,
Concord, near Boston,' and dated at Jersey, respectively,
July 1, 1801, April 22, 1804, and
April 11, 1806; also a '<em>Vue de la ville de St.
Helier</em>,' accompanying the first letter. The first
is in answer to one from my aunt Elizabeth, announcing
the death of her father (my grandfather).
He states that his mother (Marie (le Galais)
Thoreau) died June 26, 1801, the day before
he received aunt Elizabeth's letter, though not
till after he had heard from another source of
the death of his brother, which was not communicated
to his mother. 'She was in the seventy-ninth
year of her age,' he says, 'and retained her
memory to the last. She lived with my two sisters,
who took the greatest care of her.' He
says that he had written to my grandfather about
his oldest brother (who died about a year before),
but had got no answer,&mdash;had written that
he left his children, two sons and a daughter, in
a good way: 'The eldest son and daughter are
both married and have children; the youngest is
about eighteen. I am still a widower. Of four
children I have but two left,&mdash;Betsey and Peter;
James and Nancy are both at rest.' He
adds that he sends 'a view of our native town.'</p>

<p>"The second of these letters is sent by the
hand of Captain John Harvey, of Boston, then at
Guernsey. On the 4th of February, 1804, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
had sent aunt Elizabeth a copy of the last letter
he had written (which was in answer to her second),
since he feared she had not received it.
He says that they are still at war with the French;
that they received the day before a letter from
her 'uncle and aunt Le Cappelain of London;'
complains of not receiving letters, and says, 'Your
aunts, Betsey and Peter join with me,' etc. According
to the third letter (April 11, 1806), he
had received by Capt. Touzel an answer to that
he sent by Capt. Harvey, and will forward this
by the former, who is going <em>via</em> Newfoundland
to Boston. 'He expects to go there every year;
several vessels from Jersey go there every year.'
His nephew had told him, some time before, that
he met a gentleman from Boston, who told him
he saw the sign 'Thoreau and Hayse' there, and
he therefore thinks the children must have kept
up the name of the firm. 'Your cousin John is a
lieutenant in the British service; he has already
been in a campaign on the Continent; he is very
fond of it.' Aunt Maria thinks the correspondence
ceased at Peter's death, because he was the
one who wrote English."</p></div>

<p>These memoranda indicate that the grandfather
of Henry Thoreau was the younger
son of a family of some substance in Jersey,
which had a branch in London and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
grandson in the army that fought under
Wellington against Napoleon; that the
American Thoreau engaged in trade in
Boston, with a partner, and carried on business
successfully for years; and that there
was the same pleasant family feeling in the
English and French Thoreaus that we shall
see in their American descendants. Miss
Maria Thoreau, in answer to a letter of
mine, some years ago, sent me the following
particulars of her ancestry, some of
which repeat what is above stated by her
nephew:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="datesig">
"<span class="smcap">Bangor</span>, <em>March 18, 1878</em>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Sanborn.</span>
</p>

<p>"<em>Dear Sir</em>,&mdash;In answer to your letter, I
regret that I cannot find more to communicate.
I have no earlier record of my grandparents,
Philippe Thoreau and Marie Le Gallais, than
a certificate of their baptism in St. Helier, Jersey,
written on parchment in the year 1773.
I do not know what their vocation was. My
Father was born in St. Helier in April, 1754,
and was married to Jane Burns in Boston, in
1781. She died in that city in the year 1796,
aged forty-two years. My sister Elizabeth continued
my Father's correspondence with his
brother, Uncle Peter Thoreau, at St. Helier, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
a number of years after Father's decease, and in
one of his letters he speaks of the death of grandmother,
Marie Le Gallais, as taken place so near
the time intelligence reach'd them of Father's
death, in 1801, it was not communicated to her.
Father removed to Concord in 1800, and died
there, of consumption. I do not know at what
time he emigrated to this country, but have been
told he was shipwreck'd on the passage, and suffered
much. I think he must have left a large
family circle, as Uncle Peter in his letters refers
to aunts and cousins, two of which, aunts Le Cappelain
and Pinkney, resided in London, and a
cousin, John Thoreau, was an officer in the British
army.</p>

<p>"Soon after Father's arrival in Boston, probably,
he open'd a store on Long Wharf, as documents
addressed to 'John Thoreau, merchant,'
appear to signify, and one subsequently purchased
'on King Street, afterward called State
Street.' And now I will remark in passing that
Henry's father was bred to the mercantile line,
and continued in it till failure in business; when
he resorted to pencil-making, and succeeded so
well as to obtain the first medal at the Salem
Mechanics' Fair. I think Henry could hardly
compete with his father in pencil-making, any
more than he, with his peculiar genius and habits,
would have been willing to spend much time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
in such 'craft.' His father left no will, but a
competency, at least, to his family, and what
was done relative to the business after his death
was accomplished by his daughter Sophia. I
mention this to rectify Mr. Page's mistake relating
to Henry.</p>

<p>"And now, as I have written all I can glean
of Father's family, I will turn to the maternal
side, of which it appears, in religious belief, they
were of the Quaker persuasion. But I was sorry
to see, by good old great-great-grandfather Tillet's
will, that slavery was tolerated in those days
in the good State of Massachusetts, and handed
down from generation to generation. My great-grandmother
(Tillet) married David Orrok; her
daughter, Sarah Orrok, married Mr. Burns, a
Scotch gentleman. At what time he came to
this country, or married, I cannot ascertain,
but have often been told, to gain the consent
to it of grandmother's Quaker parents, he was
obliged to doff his rich apparel of gems and ruffles,
and conform to the more simple garb of his
Quaker bride. On a visit to his home in Scotland
he died, in what year is not mentioned.
Before my father's decease, a letter was received
from the executor of grandfather's estate, dated
Stirling, informing him there was property left
to Jane Burns, his daughter in America, 'well
worth coming after.' But Father was too much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
out of health to attend to the getting it; and the
letter, subsequently put into a lawyer's hands
by Brother, then the only heir, was lost.</p>

<p>"It has been said I inherit more of the traits
of my foreign ancestry than any of my family,&mdash;which
pleases me. Probably the vivacity of the
French and the superstition of the Scotch may
somewhat characterize me,&mdash;which it is to be
hop'd the experience of an octogenarian may
suitably modify. But this is nothing, here nor
there. And now that I have written all that is
necessary, and perhaps more, I will close, with
kind wishes for health and happiness. Yours
respectfully,</p>

</p></div>

<p>It would be hard to compress more family
history into a short letter, and yet leave
it so sprightly in style as this. Of the four
children of Maria Thoreau's brother John
and Cynthia Dunbar,&mdash;John, Helen, Henry,
and Sophia,&mdash;the two eldest, John and
Helen, were said to be "clear Thoreau,"
and the others, Henry and Sophia, "clear
Dunbar;" though in fact the Thoreau
traits were marked in Henry also. Let us
see, then, who and what were the family of
Henry Thoreau's mother, Cynthia Dunbar,
who was born in Keene, N. H., in 1787.
She was the daughter of Rev. Asa Dunbar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
who was born at Bridgewater, Mass., in
1745; graduated at Harvard College in
1767 (a classmate of Sir Thomas Bernard
and Increase Sumner); preached for a
while at Bedford, near Concord, in 1769,
when he was "a young candidate, newly
begun to preach;" settled in Salem in 1772;
resigned his pastorate in 1779; and removed
to Keene just at the close of the
Revolution, where he became a lawyer, and
died, a little upwards of forty-two, in 1787.
He married before 1775, Miss Mary Jones,
the daughter of Col. Elisha Jones, of Weston,
a man of wealth and influence in his
town, who died in 1776. Mrs. Mary
(Jones) Dunbar long outlived the husband
of her youth; in middle life she married
a Concord farmer, Jonas Minott, whom she
also outlived; and it was in his house that
her famous grandson was born in July,
1817. Mrs. Minott was left a widow for
the second time in 1813, when she was
sixty-five years old, and in 1815 she sent a
petition to the Grand Lodge of Masons in
Massachusetts, which was drawn up and
indorsed by her pastor, Dr. Ripley, of Concord,
and which contains a short sketch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
of Henry Thoreau's maternal grandfather,
from whom he is said to have inherited
many qualities. Mrs. Minott's petition sets
forth "that her first husband, Asa Dunbar,
Esq., late of Keene, N. H., was a native
of Massachusetts; that he was for a number
of years settled in the gospel ministry at
Salem; that afterwards he was a counselor-at-law;
that he was Master of a Lodge of
Free and Accepted Masons at Keene, where
he died; that in the cause of Masonry he
was interested and active; that through
some defection or misfortune of that Lodge
<em>she</em> has suffered loss, both on account of
what was due to him and to her, at whose
house they held their meetings; that in the
settlement of the estate of her late husband,
Jonas Minott, Esq., late of Concord, she
has been peculiarly unfortunate, and become
very much straitened in the means of
living comfortably; that being thus reduced,
and feeling the weight of cares, of
years, and of widowhood to be very heavy,
after having seen better days, she is induced,
by the advice of friends, as well as
her own exigencies, to apply for aid to
the benevolence and charity of the Masonic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
fraternity." At the house of this decayed
gentlewoman, about two years after the
date of this petition, Henry Thoreau was
born. She lived to see him running about,
a sprightly boy, and he remembered her
with affection. One of his earliest recollections
of Concord was of driving in a
chaise with his grandmother along the
shore of Walden Pond, perhaps on the way
to visit her relatives in Weston, and thinking,
as he said afterward, that he should
like to live there.</p>

<p>Ellery Channing, whose life of his friend
Henry is a mine of curious information on
a thousand topics, relevant and irrelevant,
and who often traversed the "old Virginia
road" with Thoreau before the house in
which he was born was removed from its
green knoll to a spot further east, where
it now stands, thus pictures the brown
farm-house and its surroundings: "It was
a perfect piece of our old New England
style of building, with its gray, unpainted
boards, its grassy, unfenced door-yard. The
house is somewhat isolate and remote from
thoroughfares; on the Virginia road, an
old-fashioned, winding, at length deserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
pathway, the more smiling for its forked
orchards, tumbling walls, and mossy banks.
About it are pleasant sunny meadows, deep
with their beds of peat, so cheering with its
homely, hearth-like fragrance; and in front
runs a constant stream through the centre
of that great tract sometimes called 'Bedford
levels,'&mdash;the brook a source of the
Shawsheen River." (This is a branch of
the Merrimac, as Concord River is, but
flows into the main stream through Andover,
and not through Billerica and Lowell,
as the Concord does.) The road on which
it stands, a mile and a half east of the
Fitchburg railroad station, and perhaps a
mile from Thoreau's grave in the village
cemetery, is a by-path from Concord to
Lexington, through the little town of Bedford.
The farm-house, with its fields and
orchard, was a part of Mrs. Minott's "widow's
thirds," on which she was living at
the date of her grandson's birth (July 12,
1817), and which her son-in-law, John
Thoreau, was "carrying on" for her that
year.</p>

<p>Mrs. Minott, a few years before Dr. Ripley's
petition in her behalf, came near having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
a more distinguished son-in-law, Daniel
Webster, who, like the young Dunbars, was
New Hampshire born, and a year or two
older than Mrs. Minott's daughter, Louisa
Dunbar. He had passed through Dartmouth
College a little in love with two or
three of the young ladies of Hanover, and
had returned to his native town of Salisbury,
N. H., when he met in Boscawen,
near by, Miss Louisa, who, like Miss Grace
Fletcher, whom he married a few years
afterward, was teaching school in one of the
New Hampshire towns. Miss Dunbar made
an impression on Webster's heart, always
susceptible, and, had the fates been propitious,
he might have called Henry Thoreau
nephew in after years; but the silken tie
was broken before it was fairly knit. I suspect
that she was the person referred to by
one of Webster's biographers, who says,
speaking of an incident that occurred in
January, 1805: "Mr. Webster, at that time,
had no thought of marrying; he had not
even met the lady who afterward became
his wife. He had been somewhat interested
in another lady, who is occasionally referred
to in his letters, written after he left college,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
but who was not either of those whom
he had known at Hanover. But this affair
never proceeded very far, and he had entirely
dismissed it from his mind before he
went to Boston in 1804." In January, 1806,
about the time of his father's death, Webster
wrote to a college friend, "I am not
married, and seriously am inclined to think
I never shall be," though he was then a
humble suitor to Grace Fletcher.</p>

<p>Louisa Dunbar was a lively, dark-haired,
large-eyed, pleasing young lady, who had
perhaps been educated in part at Boscawen,
where Webster studied for college, and afterwards
was a school-teacher there. She
received from him those attentions which
young men give to young ladies without
any very active thoughts of marriage; but
he at one time paid special attentions to
her, which might have led to matrimony,
perhaps, if Webster had not soon after fallen
under the sway of a more fascinating
school-teacher, Miss Grace Fletcher, of Hopkinton,
N. H., whom he first saw at the
door of her little school-house in Salisbury,
not far from his own birthplace. A Concord
matron, a neighbor and friend of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Dunbars and Thoreaus, heard the romantic
story from Webster's own lips forty years
afterward, as she was driving with him
through the valley of the Assabet: how he
was traveling along a New Hampshire road
in 1805, stopped at a school-house to ask
a question or leave a message, and was
met at the door by that vision of beauty
and sweetness, Grace Fletcher herself, to
whom he yielded his heart at once. From
a letter of Webster's to this Concord friend
(Mrs. Louisa Cheney) I quote this description
of his native region, which has never
been printed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="datesig">
"<span class="smcap">Franklin, N. H.</span>, <em>September 29, '45</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Cheney</span>,&mdash;You are hardly expecting
to hear from me in this remote region of
the earth. Where I am was originally a part of
Salisbury, the place of my birth; and, having
continued to own my father's farm, I sometimes
make a visit to this region. The house is on the
west bank of Merrimac River, fifteen miles
above Concord (N. H.), in a pleasant valley,
made rather large by a turn in the stream, and
surrounded by high and wooded hills. I came
here five or six days ago, alone, to try the effect
of the mountain air upon my health.</p>

<p>"This is a very picturesque country. The hills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
are high, numerous, and irregular,&mdash;some with
wooded summits, and some with rocky heads as
white as snow. I went into a pasture of mine
last week, lying high up on one of the hills, and
had there a clear view of the White Mountains
in the northeast, and of Ascutney, in Vermont,
back of Windsor, in the west; while within these
extreme points was a visible scene of mountains
and dales, lakes and streams, farms and forests.
I really think this region is the true Switzerland
of the United States.</p>

<p>"I am attracted to this particular spot by very
strong feelings. It is the scene of my early
years; and it is thought, and I believe truly,
that these scenes come back upon us with renewed
interest and more strength of feeling as
we find years running over us. White stones,
visible from the window, and close by, mark the
grave of my father, my mother, one brother, and
three sisters. Here are the same fields, the same
hills, the same beautiful river, as in the days of
my childhood. The human beings which knew
them now know them no more. Few are left
with whom I shared either toil or amusement in
the days of youth. But this is melancholy and
personal, and enough of it. One mind cannot
enter fully into the feelings of another in regard
to the past, whether those feelings be joyous or
melancholy, or, which is more commonly the case,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
partly both. I am, dear Mrs. Cheney, yours
truly,</p>

<p class="author">
"<span class="smcap">Daniel Webster</span>."<br />
</p></div>

<p>No doubt the old statesman was thinking,
as he wrote, not only of his father,
Captain Ebenezer Webster ("with a complexion,"
said Stark, under whom he fought
at Bennington, "that burnt gunpowder
could not change"), of his mother and his
brethren, but also of Grace Fletcher,&mdash;and
echoing in his heart the verse of Wordsworth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Among thy mountains did I feel<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The joy of my desire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she I cherished turned her wheel<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beside a cottage fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy mornings showed, thy nights concealed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The bowers where Lucy played;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thine, too, is the last green field<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That Lucy's eyes surveyed."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was no such deep sentiment as this which
Louisa Dunbar had inspired in young Webster's
breast; but he walked and talked
with her, took her to drive in his chaise up
and down the New Hampshire hills, and
no doubt went with her to church and to
prayer-meeting. She once surprised me by
confiding to me (as we were talking about
Webster in the room where Henry Thoreau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
afterwards died, and where there hung
then an engraving by Rowse of Webster's
magnificent head) "that she regarded Mr.
Webster, under Providence, as the means
of her conversion." Upon my asking how,
she said that, in one of their drives,&mdash;perhaps
in the spring of 1804,&mdash;he had spoken
to her so seriously and scripturally on the
subject of religion that her conscience was
awakened, and she soon after joined the
church, of which she continued through life
a devout member. Her friendship for Mr.
Webster also continued, and in his visits to
Concord, which were frequent from 1843 to
1849, he generally called on her, or she was
invited to meet him at the house of Mr.
Cheney, where, among social and political
topics, Webster talked with her of the old
days at Boscawen and Salisbury.</p>

<p>Cynthia Dunbar, the mother of Henry
Thoreau, was born in Keene, N. H., in
1787, the year that her father died. Her
husband, John Thoreau, who was a few
months younger than herself, was born in
Boston. When Henry Thoreau first visited
Keene, in 1850, he made this remark:
"Keene Street strikes the traveler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
favorably; it is so wide, level, straight,
and long. I have heard one of my relatives
who was born and bred there [Louisa
Dunbar, no doubt] say that you could see
a chicken run across it a mile off." His
mother hardly lived there long enough to
notice the chickens a mile off, but she occasionally
visited her native town after her
marriage in 1812, and a kinswoman (Mrs.
Laura Dunbar Ralston, of Washington, D. C.),
now living, says, "I recollect Mrs.
Thoreau as a handsome, high-spirited woman,
half a head taller than her husband,
accomplished, after the manner of those
days, with a voice of remarkable power and
sweetness in singing." She was fond of
dress, and had a weakness, not uncommon
in her day, for ribbons, which her austere
friend, Miss Mary Emerson (aunt of R. W.
Emerson), once endeavored to rebuke in a
manner of her own. In 1857, when Mrs.
Thoreau was seventy years old, and Miss
Emerson eighty-four, the younger lady
called on the elder in Concord, wearing
bonnet-ribbons of a good length and of a
bright color,&mdash;perhaps yellow. During the
call, in which Henry Thoreau was the subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
of conversation, Miss Emerson kept
her eyes shut. As Mrs. Thoreau and her
daughter Sophia rose to go, the little old
lady said, "Perhaps you noticed, Mrs.
Thoreau, that I closed my eyes during your
call. I did so because I did not wish to
look on the ribbons you are wearing, so unsuitable
for a child of God and a person of
your years."</p>

<p>In uttering this reproof, Miss Emerson
may have had in mind the clerical father
of Mrs. Thoreau, Rev. Asa Dunbar, whom
she was old enough to remember. He was
settled in Salem as the colleague of Rev.
Thomas Barnard, after a long contest which
led to the separation of the First Church
there, and the formation of the Salem
North Church in 1772. The parishioners
of Mr. Dunbar declared their new minister
"admirably qualified for a gospel preacher,"
and he seems to have proved himself a
learned and competent minister. But his
health was infirm, and this fact, as one
authority says, "soon threw him into the
profession of the law, which he honorably
pursued for a few years at Keene."
Whether he went at once to Keene on leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Salem in 1779 does not appear, but he
was practicing law there in 1783, and was
also a leading Freemason. His diary for a
few years of his early life&mdash;a faint foreshadowing
of his grandson's copious journals&mdash;is
still in existence, and indicates
a gay and genial disposition, such as Mrs.
Thoreau had. His only son, Charles Dunbar,
who was born in February, 1780, and
died in March, 1856, inherited this gaiety
of heart, but also that lack of reverence
and discipline which is proverbial in New
England for "ministers' sons and deacons'
daughters." His nephew said of him, "He
was born the winter of the great snow, and
he died in the winter of another great snow,&mdash;a
life bounded by great snows." At the
time of Henry Thoreau's birth, Mrs. Thoreau's
sisters, Louisa and Sarah, and their
brother Charles were living in Concord, or
not far off, and there Louisa Dunbar died
a few years before Mrs. Thoreau. Her
brother Charles, who was two years older
than Daniel Webster, was a person widely
known in New Hampshire and Massachusetts,
and much celebrated by Thoreau in
his journals. At the time of his death, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
find the following curious entries, in Thoreau's
journal for April 3, 1856:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"People are talking about my uncle Charles.
George Minott [a sort of cousin of the Thoreaus]
tells how he heard Tilly Brown once asking
him to show him a peculiar inside lock in wrestling.
'Now, don't hurt me,&mdash;don't throw
me hard.' He struck his antagonist inside his
knees with his feet, and so deprived him of his
legs. Edmund Hosmer remembers his tricks in
the bar-room, shuffling cards, etc.; he could do
anything with cards, yet he did not gamble. He
would toss up his hat, twirling it over and over,
and catch it on his head invariably. He once
wanted to live at Hosmer's, but the latter was
afraid of him. 'Can't we study up something?'
he asked. Hosmer asked him into the house,
and brought out apples and cider, and uncle
Charles talked. 'You!' said he, 'I burst the
bully of Haverhill.' He wanted to wrestle,&mdash;would
not be put off. 'Well, we won't wrestle
in the house.' So they went out to the yard, and
a crowd got round. 'Come, spread some straw
here,' said uncle Charles,&mdash;'I don't want to
hurt him.' He threw him at once. They tried
again; he told them to spread more straw, and
he 'burst' him. Uncle Charles used to say that
he hadn't a single tooth in his head. The fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
was they were all double, and I have heard that
he lost about all of them by the time he was
twenty-one. Ever since I knew him he could
swallow his nose. He had a strong head, and
never got drunk; would drink gin sometimes,
but not to excess. Did not use tobacco, except
snuff out of another's box, sometimes; was very
neat in his person; was not profane, though vulgar."</p></div>

<p>This was the uncle who, as Thoreau said
in "Walden," "goes to sleep shaving himself,
and is obliged to sprout potatoes in a
cellar Sundays in order to keep awake and
keep the Sabbath." He was a humorous,
ne'er-do-weel character, who, with a little
property, no family, and no special regard
for his reputation, used to move about
from place to place, a privileged jester, athlete,
and unprofessional juggler. One of
his tricks was to swallow all the knives and
forks and some of the plates at the tavern
table, and then offer to restore them if the
landlord would forgive him the bill. I remember
this worthy in his old age, an
amusing guest at his brother-in-law's table,
where his nephew plied him with questions.
We shall find him mentioned again, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> connection
with Daniel Webster's friendship
for the Dunbar family.</p>

<p>Thoreau's mother had this same incessant
and rather malicious liveliness that in
Charles Dunbar took the grotesque form
above hinted at. She was a kindly, shrewd
woman, with traditions of gentility and sentiments
of generosity, but with sharp and
sudden flashes of gossip and malice, which
never quite amounted to ill-nature, but
greatly provoked the prim and commonplace
respectability that she so often came in
contact with. Along with this humorous
quality there went also an affectionate earnestness
in her relation with those who depended
on her, that could not fail to be
respected by all who knew the hard conditions
that New England life, even in a favored
village like Concord, then imposed
on the mother of a family, where the outward
circumstances were not in keeping
with the inward aspiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<p>Her husband was a grave and silent, but
inwardly cheerful and social person, who
found no difficulty in giving his wife the
lead in all affairs. The small estate he
inherited from his father, the first John
Thoreau, was lost in trade, or by some
youthful indiscretions, of which he had his
quiet share; and he then, about 1823, turned
his attention to pencil-making, which had
by that time become a lucrative business in
Concord. He had married in 1812, and he
died in 1859. He was a small, deaf, and
unobtrusive man, plainly clad, and "minding
his own business;" very much in contrast
with his wife, who was one of the
most unceasing talkers ever seen in Concord.
Her gift in speech was proverbial,
and wherever she was the conversation fell
largely to her share. She fully verified
the Oriental legend, which accounts for the
greater loquacity of women by the fact
that nine baskets of talk were let down from
heaven to Adam and Eve in their garden,
and that Eve glided forward first and secured
six of them. Old Dr. Ripley, a few
years before his death, wrote a letter to his
son, towards the end of which he said, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
courteous reticence, "I meant to have filled
a page with sentiments. But <em>a kind neighbor</em>,
Mrs. Thoreau, has been here more than
an hour. This letter must go in the mail
to-day." Her conversation generally put a
stop to other occupations; and when at her
table Henry Thoreau's grave talk with others
was interrupted by this flow of speech
at the other end of the board, he would
pause, and wait with entire and courteous
silence, until the interruption ceased, and
then take up the thread of his own discourse
where he had dropped it; bowing to
his mother, but without a word of comment
on what she had said.</p>

<p>Dr. Ripley was the minister of Concord
for half a century, and in his copious manuscripts,
still preserved, are records concerning
his parishioners of every conceivable
kind. He carefully kept even the smallest
scrap that he ever wrote, and among his papers
I once found a fragment, on one side of
which was written a pious meditation, and
on the other a certificate to this effect: "Understanding
that Mr. John Thoreau, now of
Chelmsford, is going into business in that
place, and is about to apply for license to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
retail ardent spirits, I hereby certify that I
have been long acquainted with him, that
he has sustained a good character, and now
view him as a man of integrity, accustomed
to store-keeping, and of correct morals."
There is no date, but the time was about
1818. Chelmsford is a town ten miles north
of Concord, to which John Thoreau had removed
for three years, in the infancy of
Henry. From Chelmsford he went to Boston
in 1821, but was successful in neither
place, and soon returned to Concord, where
he gave up trade and engaged in pencil-making,
as already mentioned.</p>

<p>From that time, about 1823, till his
death in 1859, John Thoreau led a plodding,
unambitious, and respectable life in
Concord village, educating his children, associating
with his neighbors on those terms
of equality for which Concord is famous,
and keeping clear, in a great degree, of the
quarrels, social and political, that agitated
the village. Mrs. Thoreau, on the other
hand, with her sister Louisa and her sisters-in-law,
Sarah, Maria, and Jane Thoreau,
took their share in the village bickerings.
In 1826, when Dr. Lyman Beecher, then of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Boston, Dr. John Todd, then of Groton, and
other Calvinistic divines succeeded in making
a schism in Dr. Ripley's parish, and drawing
off Trinitarians enough to found a separate
church, the Thoreaus generally seceded,
along with good old Deacon White, whose
loss Dr. Ripley bewailed. This contention
was sharply maintained for years, and was
followed by the antimasonic and antislavery
agitation. In the latter Mrs. Thoreau
and her family engaged zealously, and their
house remained for years headquarters for
the early abolitionists and a place of refuge
for fugitive slaves. The atmosphere of
earnest purpose, which pervaded the great
movement for the emancipation of the
slaves, gave to the Thoreau family an elevation
of character which was ever afterward
perceptible, and imparted an air of dignity
to the trivial details of life. By this time,
too,&mdash;I speak of the years from 1836 onward
till the outbreak of the civil war,&mdash;the
children of Mrs. Thoreau had reached
an age and an education which made them
noteworthy persons. Helen, the oldest
child, born in 1812, was an accomplished
teacher. John, the elder son, born in 1814<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
was one of those lovely and sunny natures
which infuse affection in all who come
within their range; and Henry, with his
peculiar strength and independence of soul,
was a marked personage among the few
who would give themselves the trouble to
understand him. Sophia, the youngest
child, born in 1819, had, along with her
mother's lively and dramatic turn, a touch
of art; and all of them, whatever their accidental
position for the time, were superior
persons. Living in a town where the ancient
forms survived in daily collision or in
friendly contact with the new ideas that
began to make headway in New England
about 1830, the Thoreaus had peculiar opportunities,
above their apparent fortunes,
but not beyond their easy reach of capacity,
for meeting on equal terms the advancing
spirit of the period.</p>

<p>The children of the house, as they grew
up, all became school-teachers, and each
displayed peculiar gifts in that profession.
But they were all something more than
teachers, and becoming enlisted early in the
antislavery cause, or in that broader service
of humanity which "plain living and high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
thinking" imply, they gradually withdrew
from that occupation,&mdash;declining the opportunities
by which other young persons,
situated as they then were, rise to worldly
success, and devoting themselves, within limits
somewhat narrow, to the pursuit of lofty
ideals. The household of which they were
loving and thoughtful members (let one be
permitted to say who was for a time domesticated
there) had, like the best families
everywhere, a distinct and individual existence,
in which each person counted for
something, and was not a mere drop in the
broad water-level that American society
tends more and more to become. To meet
one of the Thoreaus was not the same as to
encounter any other person who might happen
to cross your path. Life to them was
something more than a parade of pretensions,
a conflict of ambitions, or an incessant
scramble for the common objects of
desire. They were fond of climbing to the
hill-top, and could look with a broader and
kindlier vision than most of us on the commotions
of the plain and the mists of the
valley. Without wealth, or power, or social
prominence, they still held a rank of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
own, in scrupulous independence, and with
qualities that put condescension out of the
question. They could have applied to
themselves, individually, and without hauteur,
the motto of the French chevalier:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">"Nor king, nor duke? Your pardon, no;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am the master of Thoreau."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>They lived their life according to their
genius, without the fear of man or of "the
world's dread laugh," saying to Fortune
what Tennyson sings:&mdash;</p>

CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.</h2>


<p>Concord, the Massachusetts town in
which Thoreau was born, is to be distinguished
from the newer but larger town of
the same name which became the capital
of New Hampshire about the time the first
American Thoreau made his appearance in
"old Concord." The latter, the first inland
plantation of the Massachusetts Colony, was
bought of the Indians by Major Willard, a
Kentish man, and Rev. Peter Bulkeley, a
Puritan clergyman from the banks of the
Ouse in Bedfordshire, and was settled under
their direction in 1635. Mr. Bulkeley,
from whom Mr. Emerson and many of the
other Concord citizens of Thoreau's day
were descended, was the first minister of
the town, which then included the present
towns of Concord, Acton, Bedford, Carlisle,
and Lincoln; and among his parishioners
were the ancestors of the principal families<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
that now inhabit these towns. Concord itself,
the centre of this large tract, was
thought eligible for settlement because of
its great meadows on the Musketaquid or
Meadow River. It had been a seat of the
Massachusetts Indians, and a powerful Sachem,
Tahattawan, lived between its two
rivers, where the Assabet falls into the
slow-gliding Musketaquid. Thoreau, the
best topographer of his birthplace, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It has been proposed that the town should
adopt for its coat of arms a field verdant, with the
Concord circling nine times round. I have read
that a descent of an eighth of an inch in a mile is
sufficient to produce a flow. Our river has probably
very near the smallest allowance. But
wherever it makes a sudden bend it is shallower
and swifter, and asserts its title to be called a
river. For the most part it creeps through broad
meadows, adorned with scattered oaks, where the
cranberry is found in abundance, covering the
ground like a mossbed. A row of sunken dwarf
willows borders the stream on one or both sides,
while at a greater distance the meadow is skirted
with maples, alders, and other fluviatile trees,
overrun with the grape-vine, which bears fruit in
its season, purple, red, white, and other grapes."</p></div>

<p>From these river-grapes, by seedling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> cultivation,
a Concord gardener, in Thoreau's
manhood, bred and developed the Concord
grape, which is now more extensively grown
throughout the United States than any
other vine, and once adorned, in vineyards
large and small, the hillsides over which
Thoreau rambled. The uplands are sandy
in many places, gravelly and rocky in others,
and nearly half the township is now
covered, as it has always been, with woods
of oak, pine, chestnut, and maple. It is a
town of husbandmen, chiefly, with a few
mechanics, merchants, and professional men
in its villages; a quiet region, favorable to
thought, to rambling, and to leisure, as well
as to that ceaseless industry by which New
England lives and thrives. Its population
in 1909 approaches 5,000, but at Thoreau's
birth it did not exceed 2,000. There are
few great estates in it, and little poverty;
the mode of life has generally been plain
and simple, and was so in Thoreau's time
even more than now. When he was born,
and for some years afterward, there was but
one church, and the limits of the parish and
the township were the same. At that time
it was one of the two shire towns of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
great county of Middlesex,&mdash;Cambridge,
thirteen miles away, being the other. It
was therefore a seat of justice and a local
centre of trade,&mdash;attracting lawyers and
merchants to its public square much more
than of late years.</p>

<p>Trade in Concord then was very different
from what it has been since the railroad
began to work its revolutions. In the old
days, long lines of teams from the upper
country, New Hampshire and Vermont,
loaded with the farm products of the interior,
stopped nightly at the taverns, especially
in the winter, bound for the Boston
market, whence they returned with a cargo
for their own country. If a thaw came on,
or there was bad sleighing in Boston, the
drivers, anxious to lighten their loads, would
sell and buy in the Concord public square,
to the great profit of the numerous traders,
whose little shops stood around or near
it. Then, too, the hitching-posts in front
of the shops had full rows of wagons and
chaises from the neighboring towns fastened
there all day long; while the owners
looked over goods, priced, chaffered, and
beat down by the hour together the calicoes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
sheetings, shirtings, kerseymeres, and other
articles of domestic need,&mdash;bringing in,
also, the product of their own farms and
looms to sell or exchange. Each "store"
kept an assortment of "West India goods,"
dry goods, hardware, medicines, furniture,
boots and shoes, paints, lumber, lime, and
the miscellaneous articles of which the village
or the farms might have need; not to
mention a special trade in New England
rum and old Jamaica, hogsheads of which
were brought up every week from Boston
by teams, and sold or given away by the
glass, with an ungrudging hand. A little
earlier than the period now mentioned,
when Colonel Whiting (father of the late
eminent lawyer, Abraham Lincoln's right-hand
adviser in the law of emancipation,
William Whiting, of Boston) was a lad
in Concord village, "there were five stores
and three taverns in the middle of the
town, where intoxicating liquors were sold
by the glass to any and every body; and
it was the custom, when a person bought
even so little as fifty cents' worth of goods,
to offer him a glass of liquor, and it was
generally accepted." Such was the town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
when John Thoreau, the Jerseyman, came
there to die in 1800, and such it remained
during the mercantile days of John Thoreau,
his son, who was brought up in a
house on the public square, and learned the
business of buying and selling in the store
of Deacon White, close by. Pencil-making,
the art by which he earned his modest
livelihood during Henry Thoreau's youth,
was introduced into Concord about 1812
by William Munroe, whose son has in later
years richly endowed the small free library
from which Thoreau drew books, and
to which he gave some of his own. In this
handicraft, which was at times quite profitable,
the younger Thoreaus assisted their
father from time to time, and Henry acquired
great skill in it; even to the extent,
says Mr. Emerson, of making as good a
pencil as the best English ones. "His
friends congratulated him that he had now
opened his way to fortune. But he replied
that he should never make another pencil.
'Why should I? I would not do again
what I have done once.'" Thoreau may
have said this, but he afterward changed his
mind, for he went on many years, at intervals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
working at his father's business, which
in time grew to be mainly the preparation
of fine-ground plumbago for electrotyping.
This he supplied to various publishers, and
among others to the Harpers, for several
years. But what he did in this way was
incidental, and as an aid to his father, his
mother, or his sister Sophia, who herself
carried on the business for some time after
the death of Henry in 1862. It was the
family employment, and must be pursued
by somebody.</p>

<p>Perpetuity, indeed, and hereditary transmission
of everything that by nature and
good sense can be inherited, are among the
characteristics of Concord. The Heywood
family has been resident in Concord for two
hundred and fifty years or so, and in that
time has held the office of town clerk, in
lineal succession from father to son, for one
hundred years at least. The grandson of
the first John Heywood filled the office
(which is the most responsible in town, and
generally accompanied by other official
trusts) for eighteen years, beginning in
1731; his son held the place with a slight
interregnum for thirteen years; his nephew,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Dr. Abiel Heywood, was town clerk from
1796 to 1834 without a break, and Dr. Heywood's
son, Mr. George Heywood, was the
town clerk for thirty-odd years after March,
1853.</p>

<p>Of the dozen ministers who, since 1635,
have preached in the parish church, five
were either Bulkeleys or Emersons, descendants
of the first minister, or else connected
by marriage with that clerical line;
and the young minister who, in the year
1882, accepted the pastorate of Rev. Peter
Bulkeley, is a descendant, and bears the
same name. Mr. Emerson himself, the great
clerk of Concord, which was his lay parish
for almost half a century after he ceased to
preach in its pulpit, counted among his ancestors
four of the Concord pastors, whose
united ministry covered a century; while
his grandmother's second husband, Dr.
Ripley, added a half century more to the
family ministry. For this ancestral claim,
quite as much as for his gift of wit and
eloquence, Mr. Emerson was chosen, in
1835, to commemorate by an oration the
two hundredth anniversary of the town settlement.
In this discourse he said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have had much opportunity of access to
anecdotes of families, and I believe this town to
have been the dwelling-place, in all times since
its planting, of pious and excellent persons, who
walked meekly through the paths of common
life, who served God and loved man, and never
let go their hope of immortality. I find our annals
marked with a uniform good sense. I find
no ridiculous laws, no eavesdropping legislators,
no hanging of witches, no ghosts, no whipping of
Quakers, no unnatural crimes. The old town
clerks did not spell very correctly, but they contrived
to make pretty intelligible the will of a
free and just community."</p></div>

<p>Into such a community Henry Thoreau,
a free and just man, was born. Dr. Heywood,
above-named, was the first town
clerk he remembered, and the one who entered
on the records the marriage of his
father and mother, and the birth of all the
children. He cried the banns of John Thoreau
and Cynthia Dunbar in the parish
meeting-house; and he was the last clerk
who made this Sunday outcry.</p>

<p>He thus proclaimed his own autumnal
nuptials in 1822, when he married for the
first time at the age of sixty-three. The
banns were cried at the opening of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
service, and this compelled the town clerk
to be a more regular attendant in the meeting-house
than his successors have found
necessary. Dr. Heywood's pew was about
half-way down the broad aisle, and in full
view of the whole congregation, whether
in the "floor pews" or "up in the galleries."
Wearing his old-fashioned coat and
small-clothes, the doctor would rise in his
pew, deliberately adjust his spectacles, and
look about for a moment, in order to make
sure that his audience was prepared; then
he made his proclamation with much emphasis
of voice and dignity of manner.
There was a distinction, however, in the
manner of "publishing the banns" of the
white and the black citizens; the former being
"cried" in the face of the whole congregation,
and the latter simply "posted" in
the meeting-house porch, as was afterwards
the custom for all. Dr. Heywood, from a
sense of justice, or some other proper motive,
determined on one occasion to "post"
a white couple, instead of giving them the
full benefit of his sonorous voice; but, either
because they missed the <em>éclat</em> of the usual
proclamation, or else felt humiliated at being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
"posted like niggers in the porch,"
they brought the town clerk to justice forthwith,
and he was forced for once to yield to
popular outcry, and join in the outcry himself.
After publishing his own banns, and
just before the wedding, he for the first
time procured a pair of trousers,&mdash;having
worn knee-breeches up to that time, as Colonel
May (the father-in-law of Mr. Alcott)
and others had thought it proper to wear
them. When Dr. Heywood told his waggish
junior, 'Squire Brooks, of the purchase,
and inquired how young gentlemen put
their trousers on, his legal neighbor advised
him that they were generally put on over
the head.</p>

<p>Dr. Heywood survived amid "this age
loose and all unlaced," as Marvell says, until
1839, having practiced medicine, more
or less, in Concord for upward of forty
years, and held court there as a local justice
for almost as long. Dr. Isaac Hurd,
who was his contemporary, practiced in
Concord for fifty-four years, and in all sixty-five
years; and Dr. Josiah Bartlett, who
accompanied and succeeded Dr. Hurd, practiced
in Concord nearly fifty-eight years;
while the united medical service of himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
and his father, Dr. Josiah Bartlett of
Charlestown, was one hundred and two
years.</p>

<p>Dr. Bartlett himself was one of the most
familiar figures in Concord through Thoreau's
life-time, and for fifteen years after.
To him have been applied, with more truth,
I suspect, than to "Mr. Robert Levet, a
Practiser in Physic," those noble lines of
Dr. Johnson on his humble friend:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Well tried through many a varying year,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">See Levet to the grave descend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Officious, innocent, sincere,<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><em>Of every friendless name the friend</em>."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>He said more than once that for fifty years
no severity of weather had kept him from
visiting his distant patients,&mdash;sometimes
miles away,&mdash;except once, and then the
snow was piled so high that his sleigh upset
every two rods; and when he unharnessed
and mounted his horse, the beast, floundering
through a drift, slipped him off over his
crupper. He was a master of the horse,
and encouraged that proud creature to do
his best in speed. One of his neighbors
mentioned in his hearing a former horse of
Dr. Bartlett's, which was in the habit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
running away. "By faith!" said the doctor
(his familiar oath), "I recollect that
horse; he was a fine traveler, but I have
no remembrance that he ever ran away."
When upwards of seventy, he was looking
for a new horse. The jockey said, "Doctor,
if you were not so old, I have a horse
that would suit you." "Hm!" growled the
doctor, "don't talk to me about <em>old</em>. Let's
see your horse;" and he bought him, and
drove him for eight years. He practiced
among the poor with no hope of reward,
and gave them, besides, his money, his
time, and his influence. One day a friend
saw him receiving loads of firewood from a
shiftless man to whom he had rendered
gratuitous service in sickness for twenty
years. "Ah, doctor! you are getting some
of your back pay." "By faith! no; the
fellow is poor, so I paid him for his wood,
and let him go."</p>

<p>Dr. Bartlett did not reach Concord quite
in season to assist at the birth of Henry
Thoreau; but from the time his parents
brought him back to his native town from
Boston, in 1823, to the day of Sophia Thoreau's
death, in 1876, he might have supplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the needed medical aid to the family,
and often did so. The young Henry dwelt
in his first tabernacle on the Virginia road
but eight months, removing then to a
house on the Lexington road, not far from
where Mr. Emerson afterwards established
his residence, on the edge of Concord village.
In the mean time he had been baptized
by Dr. Ripley in the parish church, at
the age of three months; and his mother
boasted that he did not cry. His aunt,
Sarah Thoreau, taught him to walk when
he was fourteen months old, and before he
was sixteen months he removed to Chelmsford,
"next to the meeting-house, where
they kept the powder, in the garret," as was
the custom in many village churches of
New England then. Coming back to Concord
before he was six years old, he soon
began to drive his mother's cow to pasture,
barefoot, like other village boys; just as
Emerson, when a boy in Boston, a dozen
years before, had driven his mother's cow
where now the fine streets and halls are.
Thoreau, like Emerson, began to go to
school in Boston, where he lived for a year
or more in Pinckney Street. But he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> returned
to Concord in 1823, and, except for
short visits or long walking excursions, he
never left the town again till he died, in
1862. He there went on with his studies
in the village schools, and fitted for Harvard
College at the "Academy," which
'Squire Hoar, Colonel Whiting, 'Squire
Brooks, and other magnates of the town
had established about 1820. This private
school was generally very well taught, and
here Thoreau himself taught for a while in
after years. In his boyhood it had become
a good place to study Greek, and in 1830,
when perhaps Henry Thoreau was one of
its pupils, Mr. Charles Emerson, visiting
his friends in Concord, wrote thus of what
he saw there: "Mr. George Bradford and
I attended the Exhibition yesterday at the
Academy. We were extremely gratified.
To hear little girls saying their Greek
grammar and young ladies read Xenophon
was a new and very agreeable entertainment."
Thoreau must have been beginning
his Greek grammar about that time,
for he entered college in 1833, and was
then proficient in Greek. He must also
have gone, as a boy, to the "Concord Lyceum,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
where he afterwards lectured every
winter. Concord, as the home of famous
lawyers and active politicians, was always a
place of resort for political leaders, and
Thoreau might have seen and heard there
all the celebrated congressmen and governors
of Massachusetts, at one time and another.
He could remember the visit of
Lafayette to Concord in 1824, and the semi-centennial
celebration of the Concord Fight
in 1825. In 1830 he doubtless looked forward
with expectation for the promised
lecture of Edward Everett before the Lyceum,
concerning which Mr. Everett wrote
as follows to Dr. Ripley (November 3,
1830):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I am positively forbidden by my physician to
come to Concord to-day. To obviate, as far as
possible, the inconvenience which this failure
might cause the Lyceum, I send you the lecture
which I should have delivered. It is one which
I have delivered twice before; but my health
has prevented me from preparing another. Although
<em>in print</em>, as you see, it has <em>not been published</em>.
I held it back from publication to enable
me, with propriety, to deliver it at Concord.
Should you think it worth while to have it read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
to the meeting, it is at your service for that purpose;
and, should this be done, I would suggest,
as it is one hour and three quarters long, that
some parts should be omitted. For this reason
I have inclosed some passages in brackets, which
can be spared without affecting the context."</p></div>

<p>It would hardly occur to a popular lecturer
now to apologize because he had delivered
his lecture twice before, or to send
the copy forward, when he could not himself
be there to read it.</p>

<p>Mr. Emerson began to lecture in the
Concord Lyceum before 1834, when he
came to reside in the town. In October of
that year he wrote to Dr. Ripley, declining
to give the opening lecture, but offering to
speak in the course of the winter, as he did.
During its first half century he lectured nearly
a hundred times in this Lyceum, reading
there, first and last, nearly all the essays he
published in his lifetime, and many that
have since been printed. Thoreau gave
his first lecture there in April, 1838, and
afterwards lectured nearly every year for
more than twenty years. On one occasion,
very early in his public career, when the
expected lecturer of the Lyceum failed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
come, as Mr. Everett had failed, but had
not been thoughtful enough to send a substitute,
Henry Thoreau and Mr. Alcott
were pressed into the service, and spoke
before the audience in duet, and with opinions
extremely heretical,&mdash;both being ardent
radicals and "come-outers." A few years
after this (in 1843), Wendell Phillips made
his first appearance before the Concord Lyceum,
and spoke in a manner which Thoreau
has described in print, and which led
to a sharp village controversy, not yet quite
forgotten on either side.</p>

<p>But to return to the childhood and youth
of Thoreau. When he was three or four
years old, at Chelmsford, on being told that
he must die, as well as the men in the New
England Primer, and having the joys of
heaven explained to him, he said, as he
came in from "coasting," that he did not
want to die and go to heaven, because he
could not carry his sled to so fine a place;
for, he added, "the boys say it is not shod
with iron, and not worth a cent." At the
age of ten, says Channing, "he had the
firmness of the Indian, and could repress
his pathos, and had such seriousness that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
he was called 'judge.'" As an example of
childish fortitude, it is related that he carried
his pet chickens for sale to the tavern-keeper
in a basket; whereupon Mr. Wesson
told him to 'stop a minute,' and, in order
to return the basket promptly, took the
darlings out, and wrung their necks, one by
one, before the boy's eyes, who wept inwardly,
but did not budge. Having a
knack at whittling, and being asked by a
schoolmate to make him a bow and arrow,
young Henry refused, not deigning to give
the reason,&mdash;that he had no knife. "So
through life," says Channing, "he steadily
declined trying or pretending to do what
he had no means to execute, yet forbore
explanations." He was a sturdy and kindly
playmate, whose mirthful tricks are yet remembered
by those who frolicked with him,
and he always abounded with domestic affection.
While in college he once asked
his mother what profession she would have
him choose. She said, pleasantly, "You
can buckle on your knapsack, dear, and
roam abroad to seek your fortune;" but
the thought of leaving home and forsaking
Concord made the tears roll down his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
cheeks. Then his sister Helen, who was
standing by, says Channing, "tenderly put
her arm around him and kissed him, saying,
'No, Henry, you shall not go; you
shall stay at home and live with us.'" And
this, indeed, he did, though he made one or
two efforts to seek his fortune for a time
elsewhere.</p>

<p>His reading had been wide and constant
while at school, and after he entered college
at the age of sixteen. His room in Cambridge
was in Hollis Hall; his instructors
were such as he found there, but in rhetoric
he profited much by the keen intelligence
of Professor Channing, an uncle of
his future friend and biographer, Ellery
Channing. I think he also came in contact,
while in college, with that singular poet,
Jones Very, of Salem. He was by no
means unsocial in college, though he did
not form such abiding friendships as do
many young men. He graduated in 1837.
His expenses at Cambridge, which were
very moderate, compared with what a poor
scholar must now pay to go through college,
were paid in part by his father, in part by
his aunts and his elder sister, Helen, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
had already begun to teach school; and for
the rest he depended on his own efforts and
the beneficiary funds of the college, in
which he had some little share. I have
understood that he received the income of
the same modest endowment which had
been given to William and Ralph Waldo
Emerson when in college, some years before;
and in other ways the generous thought
of that most princely man, Waldo Emerson,
was not idle in his behalf, though he knew
Thoreau then only as the studious son
of a townsman, who needed a friend at
court. What Mr. Emerson wrote to Josiah
Quincy, who was then president of Harvard
College, in behalf of Henry Thoreau
does not appear, except from the terms of
old Quincy's reply; but we may infer it.
Thoreau had the resource of school-keeping
in the country towns, during the college
vacation and the extra vacation that a poor
scholar could claim; and this brought him,
in 1835, to an acquaintance with that elder
scholar, Brownson, who afterwards became
a Catholic doctor of theology. He left college
one winter to teach school at Canton,
near Boston, where he was examined by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Rev. Orestes A. Brownson, then a Protestant
minister in Canton. He studied German
and boarded with Mr. Brownson while
he taught the school. In 1836, he records
in his journal that he "went to New York
with father, peddling." In his senior year,
1836-37, he was ill for a time, and lost rank
with his instructors by his indifference to
the ordinary college motives for study.
This fact, and also that he was a beneficiary
of the college, further appears from the
letter of President Quincy to Mr. Emerson,
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="datesig">
"<span class="smcap">Cambridge</span>, <em>25th June, 1837</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your view concerning Thoreau
is entirely in consent with that which I entertain.
His general conduct has been very satisfactory,
and I was willing and desirous that
whatever falling off there had been in his scholarship
should be attributable to his sickness. He
had, however, imbibed some notions concerning
emulation and college rank which had a natural
tendency to diminish his zeal, if not his exertions.
His instructors were impressed with the conviction
that he was indifferent, even to a degree that
was faulty, and that they could not recommend
him, consistent with the rule by which they are
usually governed in relation to beneficiaries. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
have always entertained a respect for and interest
in him, and was willing to attribute any apparent
neglect or indifference to his ill health rather than
to wilfulness. I obtained from the instructors the
authority to state all the facts to the Corporation,
and submit the result to their discretion. This I
did, and that body granted <em>twenty-five dollars</em>,
which was within <em>ten</em>, or at most <em>fifteen</em>, dollars of
any sum he would have received, had no objection
been made. There is no doubt that, from
some cause, an unfavorable opinion has been entertained,
since his return after his sickness, of
his disposition to exert himself. To what it has
been owing may be doubtful. I appreciate very
fully the goodness of his heart and the strictness
of his moral principle; and have done as much
for him as, under the circumstances, was possible.
Very respectfully, your humble servant,</p>

<p>It is possible the college faculty may
have had other grounds of distrust in Thoreau's
case. On May 30, 1836, his classmate
Peabody wrote him the following letter
from Cambridge,&mdash;Thoreau being then
at home, for some reason,&mdash;from which we
may infer that the sober youth was not
averse to such deeds as are there related:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Davy Club got into a little trouble, the
week before last, from the following circumstance:
H. W. gave a lecture on Pyrotechny,
and illustrated it with a parcel of fireworks he
had prepared in the vacation. As you may imagine,
there was some slight noise on the occasion.
In fact, the noise was so slight that Tutor
B. heard it at his room in Holworthy. This
worthy boldly determined to march forth and
attack the 'rioters.' Accordingly, in the midst
of a grand display of rockets, etc., he stepped
into the room, and, having gazed round him in
silent astonishment for the space of two minutes,
and hearing various cries of 'Intrusion!' 'Throw
him over!' 'Saw his leg off!' 'Pull his wool!'
etc., he made two or three dignified motions with
his hand to gain attention, and then kindly advised
us to 'retire to our respective rooms.'
Strange to say, he found no one inclined to follow
this good advice, and <em>he</em> accordingly thought fit
to withdraw. There is, as perhaps you know, a
law against keeping powder in the college buildings.
The effect of Tutor B.'s intrusion was
evident on the next Monday night, when H. W.
and B. were invited to call and see President
Quincy; and owing to the tough reasoning of
Tutor B., who boldly asserted that 'powder was
powder,' they were each presented with a public
admonition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"We had a miniature volcano at Webster's
lecture, the other morning [this was Professor
Webster, afterwards hanged for the murder of
Dr. Parkman], and the odors therefrom surpassed
all ever produced by Araby the Blest.
Imagine to yourself all the windows and shutters
of the lecture-room closed, and then conceive
the delightful scent produced by the burning of
nearly a bushel of sulphur, phosphoretted hydrogen,
and other still more pleasant ingredients.
As soon as the burning commenced, there was a
general rush to the door, and a crowd collected
there, running out every half minute to get a
breath of fresh air, and then coming in to see the
volcano. 'No noise nor nothing.' Bigelow and
Dr. Bacon manufactured some 'laughing gas,'
and administered it on the Delta. It was much
better than that made by Webster. Jack Weiss
took some, as usual; Wheeler, Jo Allen, and Hildreth
each received a dose. Wheeler proceeded
to dance for the amusement of the company, Jo
jumped over the Delta fence, and Sam raved
about Milton, Shakespeare, Byron, etc. He took
two doses; it produced a great effect on him.
He seemed to be as happy as a mortal could desire;
talked with Shakespeare, Milton, etc., and
seemed to be quite at home with them."</p></div>

<p>The persons named were classmates of
Thoreau: one of them afterward Rev. John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Weiss; Wheeler was of Lincoln, and died
early in Germany, whither he went to study;
Samuel Tenney Hildreth was a brother of
Richard Hildreth, the historian, and also
died young. The zest with which his classmate
related these pranks to Thoreau seems
to imply in his correspondent a mind too
ready towards such things to please the
learned faculty of Cambridge.</p>

<p>Mr. Quincy's letter was in reply to one
which Mr. Emerson had written at the request
of Mrs. Thoreau, who feared her son
was not receiving justice from the college
authorities. Thoreau graduated without
much distinction, but with a good name
among his classmates, and a high reputation
for general scholarship. When he went to
Maine, in May, 1838, to see if there was
not some school for him to teach there, he
took with him this certificate from his pastor,
Dr. Ripley:&mdash;</p>

and a graduate of Harvard University. He is
well disposed and well qualified to instruct the
rising generation. His scholarship and moral
character will bear the strictest scrutiny. He is
modest and mild in his disposition and government,
but not wanting in energy of character and
fidelity in the duties of his profession. It is presumed
his character and usefulness will be appreciated
more highly as an acquaintance with him
shall be cultivated. Cordial wishes for his success,
reputation, and usefulness attend him, as an
instructor and gentleman.</p>

"chickadedees," as he plainly declared in

</p></div>

<p>The acquaintance of Mr. Emerson with his
young townsman had begun perhaps a year
before this date, and had advanced very fast
toward intimacy. It originated in this way:
A lady connected with Mr. Emerson's family
was visiting at Mrs. Thoreau's while
Henry was in college, and the conversation
turned on a lecture lately read in Concord
by Mr. Emerson. Miss Helen Thoreau surprised
the visitor by saying, "My brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Henry has a passage in his diary containing
the same things that Mr. Emerson has said."
This remark being questioned, the diary
was produced, and, sure enough, the thought
of the two passages was found to be very
similar. The incident being reported to
Mr. Emerson, he desired the lady to bring
Henry Thoreau to see him, which was soon
done, and the intimacy began. It was to
this same lady (Mrs. Brown, of Plymouth)
that Thoreau addressed one of his earliest
poems,&mdash;the verses called "Sic Vita," in
the "Week on the Concord and Merrimac,"
commencing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I am a parcel of vain strivings, tied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By a chance bond together."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>These verses were written on a strip of
paper inclosing a bunch of violets, gathered
in May, 1837, and thrown in at Mrs.
Brown's window by the poet-naturalist.
They show that he had read George Herbert
carefully, at a time when few persons
did so, and in other ways they are characteristic
of the writer, who was then not quite
twenty years old.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to see what old
Quincy himself said, in a certificate, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
his stubbornly independent pupil. For the
same Maine journey Cambridge furnished
the Concord scholar with this document:&mdash;</p>

Henry D. Thoreau, of Concord, in this State of
Massachusetts, graduated at this seminary in August,

<p>It seems that there was question, at this

(perhaps the Theological Seminary

Thoreau might find a place; for on the

wrote to him as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>We now know that Thoreau offered himself
for the place; and we know that his
journey to Maine was fruitless. He did, in
fact, teach the town grammar school in Concord
for a few weeks in 1837, and in July,
1838, was teaching, at the Parkman house,
in Concord. He had already, as we have
seen, though not yet twenty-one, appeared
as a lecturer before the Concord Lyceum.
It is therefore time to consider him as a citizen
of Concord, and to exhibit further the
character of that town.</p>

CONCORD AND ITS FAMOUS PEOPLE.</h2>


<p>The Thoreau family was but newly
planted in Concord, to which it was alien
both by the father's and the mother's side.
But this wise town adopts readily the children
of other communities that claim its
privileges,&mdash;and to Henry Thoreau these
came by birth. Of all the men of letters that
have given Concord a name throughout the
world, he is almost the only one who was
born there. Emerson was born in Boston,
Alcott in Connecticut, Hawthorne in Salem,
Channing in Boston, Louisa Alcott in Germantown,
and others elsewhere; but Thoreau
was native to the soil. And since his
genius has been shaped and guided by the
personal traits of those among whom he
lived, as well as by the hand of God and by
the intuitive impulses of his own spirit, it
is proper to see what the men of Concord
have really been. It is from them we must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
judge the character of the town and its civilization,
not from those exceptional, imported
persons&mdash;cultivated men and women,&mdash;who
may be regarded as at the head of society,
and yet may have no representative
quality at all. It is not by the few that a
New England town is to be judged, but by
the many. Yet there were a Few and a
Many in Concord, between whom certain
distinctions could be drawn, in the face of
that general equality which the institutions
of New England compel. Life in our new
country had not yet been reduced to the
ranks of modern civilization&mdash;so orderly
outward, so full of mutiny within.</p>

<p>It is mentioned by Tacitus, in his life of
Agricola, that this noble Roman lived as a
child in Marseilles; "a place," he adds, "of
Grecian culture and provincial frugality,
mingled and well blended." I have thought
this felicitous phrase of Tacitus most apposite
for Concord as I have known it since
1854, and as Thoreau must have found it
from 1830 onward. Its people lived then
and since with little display, while learning
was held in high regard; and the "plain
living and high thinking," which Wordsworth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
declared were gone from England,
have never been absent from this New England
town. It has always been a town of
much social equality, and yet of great social
and spiritual contrasts. Most of its inhabitants
have lived in a plain way for the two
centuries and a half that it has been inhabited;
but at all times some of them have
had important connections with the great
world of politics, affairs, and literature.
Rev. Peter Bulkeley, the founder and first
minister of the town, was a near kinsman
of Oliver St. John, Cromwell's solicitor-general,
of the same noble English family
that, a generation or two later, produced
Henry St. John, Lord Bolingbroke, the
brilliant, unscrupulous friend of Pope and
Swift. Another of the Concord ministers,
Rev. John Whiting, was descended, through
his grandmother, Elizabeth St. John, wife
of Rev. Samuel Whiting, of Lynn, from this
same old English family, which, in its long
pedigree, counted for ancestors the Norman
Conqueror of England and some of his turbulent
posterity. He was, says the epitaph
over him in the village burying-ground, "a
gentleman of singular hospitality and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> generosity,
who never detracted from the character
of any man, and was a universal lover
of mankind." In this character some representative
gentleman of Concord has stood
in every generation since the first settlement
of the little town.</p>

<p>The Munroes of Lexington and Concord
are descended from a Scotch soldier of
Charles II.'s army, captured by Cromwell
at the battle of Worcester in 1651, and
allowed to go into exile in America. His
powerful kinsman, General George Munro,
who commanded for Charles at the battle
of Worcester, was, at the Restoration, made
commander-in-chief for Scotland.</p>

<p>Robert Cumming, father of Dr. John
Cumming, a celebrated Concord physician,
was one of the followers of the first Pretender
in 1715, and when the Scotch rebellion
of that year failed, Cumming, with some of
his friends, fled to New England, and settled
in Concord and the neighboring town
of Stow.</p>

<p>Duncan Ingraham, a retired sea-captain,
who had enriched himself in the Surinam
trade, long lived in Concord, before and
after the Revolution, and one of his grandchildren<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
was Captain Marryatt, the English
novelist; another was the American naval
captain, Ingraham, who brought away Martin
Kosta, a Hungarian refugee, from the
clutches of the Austrian government.
While Duncan Ingraham was living in
Concord, a hundred years ago, a lad from
that town, Joseph Perry, who had gone to
sea with Paul Jones, became a high naval
officer in the service of Catharine of Russia,
and wrote to Dr. Ripley from the Crimea
in 1786 to inquire what had become of
his parents in Concord, whom he had not
seen or heard from for many years. The
stepson of Duncan Ingraham, Tilly Merrick,
of Concord, who graduated at Cambridge
in 1773, made the acquaintance of
Sir Archibald Campbell, when captured in
Boston Harbor, that Scotch officer having
visited at the house of Mrs. Ingraham,
Merrick's mother, while a prisoner in Concord
Jail. A few years later Merrick was
himself captured twice on his way to and
from Holland and France, whither he went
as secretary or attaché to our commissioner,
John Adams. The first time he was
taken to London; the second time to Halifax,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
where, as it happened, Sir Archibald
was then in command as Governor of Nova
Scotia. Young Merrick went presently to
the governor's quarters, but was refused
admission by the sentinel,&mdash;while parleying
with whom, Sir Archibald heard the conversation,
and came forward. He at once
recognized his Concord friend, greeted him
cordially with "How do you do, my little
rebel?" and after taking good care of him,
in remembrance of his own experience in
Concord, procured Merrick's exchange for
one of Burgoyne's officers, captured at Saratoga.
Returning to America after the
war, Tilly Merrick went into an extensive
business at Charleston, S. C., with the son
of Duncan Ingraham for a partner, and
there became the owner of large plantations,
worked by slaves, which he afterwards
lost through reverses in business.
Coming back to Concord in 1798, with the
remnants of his South Carolina fortune,
and inheriting his mother's Concord estate,
he married a lady of the Minott family, and
became a country store-keeper in his native
town. His daughter, Mrs. Brooks, was for
many years the leader of the antislavery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
party in Concord, and a close friend of the
Thoreaus, who at one time lived next door
to her hospitable house.</p>

<p>Soon after Mr. Emerson fixed his home
in Concord, in 1834, a new bond of connection
between the town and the great world
outside this happy valley began to appear,&mdash;the
genius of that man whose like has
not been seen in America, nor in the whole
world in our century:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A large and generous man, who, on our moors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Built up his thought (though with an Indian tongue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fittest to have sung at Persian feasts),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet dwelt among us as the sage he was,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sage of his days,&mdash;patient and proudly true;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose word was worth the world, whose heart was pure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, such a heart was his! no gate or bar;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The poorest wretch that ever passed his door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Welcome as highest king or fairest friend."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This genius, in one point of view so solitary,
but in another so universal and social, soon
made itself felt as an attractive force, and
Concord became a place of pilgrimage, as it
has remained for so many years since.
When Theodore Parker left Divinity Hall,
at Cambridge, in 1836, and began to preach
in Unitarian pulpits, he fixed his hopes on
Concord as a parish, chiefly because Emerson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
was living there. It is said that he
might have been called as a colleague for
Dr. Ripley, if it had not been thought his
sermons were too learned for the Christians
of the Nine-Acre Corner and other outlying
hamlets of the town. In 1835-36 Mr. Alcott
began to visit Mr. Emerson in Concord,
and in 1840 he went there to live.
Margaret Fuller and Elizabeth Peabody,
coadjutors of Mr. Alcott in his Boston
school, had already found their way to Concord,
where Margaret at intervals resided,
or came and went in her sibylline way.
Ellery Channing, one of the nephews of Dr.
Channing, the divine, took his bride, a sister
of Margaret Fuller, to Concord in 1843;
and Hawthorne removed thither, upon
his marriage with Miss Peabody's sister
Sophia, in 1842. After noticing what went
on about him for a few years, in his seclusion
at the Old Manse, Hawthorne thus described
the attraction of Concord, in 1845:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It was necessary to go but a little way beyond
my threshold before meeting with stranger
moral shapes of men than might have been encountered
elsewhere in a circuit of a thousand
miles. These hobgoblins of flesh and blood were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
attracted thither by the wide-spreading influence
of a great original thinker, who had his earthly
abode at the opposite extremity of our village.
His mind acted upon other minds of a certain
constitution with wonderful magnetism, and drew
many men upon long pilgrimages to speak with
him face to face. Young visionaries, to whom
just so much of insight had been imparted as to
make life all a labyrinth around them, came to
seek the clew that should guide them out of their
self-involved bewilderment. Gray-headed theorists,
whose systems, at first air, had finally imprisoned
them in an iron framework, traveled
painfully to his door, not to ask deliverance, but
to invite the free spirit into their own thralldom.
People that had lighted on a new thought, or a
thought that they fancied new, came to Emerson,
as the finder of a glittering gem hastens to a
lapidary to ascertain its quality and value."</p></div>

<p>The picture here painted still continued
to be true until long after the death of Thoreau;
and the attraction was increased at
times by the presence in the village of
Hawthorne himself, of Alcott, and of others
who made Concord their home or their
haunt. Thoreau also was resorted to by
pilgrims, who came sometimes from long
distances and at long intervals, to see and
talk with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>There was in the village, too, a consular
man, for many years the first citizen of
Concord,&mdash;Samuel Hoar,&mdash;who made himself
known abroad by sheer force of character
and "plain heroic magnitude of mind."
It was of him that Emerson said, at his
death in November, 1856,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"He was a man in whom so rare a spirit of
justice visibly dwelt that if one had met him in
a cabin or in a forest he must still seem a public
man, answering as sovereign state to sovereign
state; and might easily suggest Milton's picture
of John Bradshaw, that he 'was a consul from
whom the fasces did not depart with the year,
but in private seemed ever sitting in judgment
on kings.' He returned from courts or congresses
to sit down with unaltered humility, in
the church or in the town-house, on the plain
wooden bench, where Honor came and sat down
beside him."</p></div>

<p>In his house and in a few others along the
elm-planted street, you might meet at any
time other persons of distinction, beauty, or
wit,&mdash;such as now and then glance through
the shining halls of cities, and, in great
centres of the world's civilization, like London
or Paris, muster</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">
"In solemn troops and sweet societies,"<br />
</p>

<p>which are the ideal of poets and fair women,
and the envy of all who aspire to social
eminence. Thoreau knew the worth of this
luxury, too, though, as a friend said of him,
"a story from a fisher or hunter was better
to him than an evening of triviality in shining
parlors, where he was misunderstood."</p>

<p>There were not many such parlors in
Concord, but there was and had constantly
been in the town a learned and social element,
such as gathers in an old New England
village of some wealth and inherited
culture. At the head of this circle&mdash;which
fell off on one side into something like fashion
and mere amusement, on another into
the activity of trade or politics, and rose,
among the women especially, into art and
literature and religion&mdash;stood, in Thoreau's
boyhood and youth, a grave figure, yet with
something droll about him,&mdash;the parish
minister and county Nestor, Dr. Ezra Ripley,
who lived and died in the "Old Manse."</p>

<p>Dr. Ripley was born in 1751, in Woodstock,
Conn., the same town in which Dr.
Abiel Holmes, the father of the poet
Holmes, was born. He entered Harvard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
College in 1772, came with the students to
Concord in 1775, when the college buildings
at Cambridge were occupied by Washington
and his army, besieging Boston, and
graduated in 1776. Among his classmates
were Governor Gore, Samuel Sewall, the
second chief-justice of Massachusetts of that
name, and Royal Tyler, the witty chief-justice
of Vermont. Governor Gore used to
say that in college he was called "Holy
Ripley," from his devout character. He
settled in Concord in 1778, and at the age
of twenty-nine married the widow of his
last predecessor, Rev. William Emerson
(and the daughter of his next predecessor,
Rev. Daniel Bliss), who was at their marriage
ten years older than her husband, and
had a family of five children. Dr. Ripley's
own children were three in number: the
Reverend Samuel Ripley, born May 11,
1783; Daniel Bliss Ripley, born August 1,
1784; and Miss Sarah Ripley, born August
8, 1789. When this daughter died, not long
after her mother, in 1826, breaking, says
Mr. Emerson, "the last tie of blood which
bound me and my brothers to his house,"
Dr. Ripley said to Mr. Emerson, "I wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
you and your brothers to come to this house
as you have always done. You will not
like to be excluded; I shall not like to be
neglected." He died himself in September,
1841.</p>

<p>Of Dr. Ripley countless anecdotes are
told in his parish, and he was the best remembered
person, except Thoreau himself,
who had died in Concord, till Emerson; just
as his house, described so finely by Hawthorne
in his "Mosses," is still the best
known house in Concord. It was for a
time the home of Mr. Emerson, and there,
it is said, he wrote his first book, "Nature,"
concerning which, when it came out anonymously,
the question was asked, "Who is
the author of 'Nature'?" The reply was,
of course, "God and Ralph Waldo Emerson."
The Old Manse was built about 1766
for Mr. Emerson's grandfather, then minister
of the parish, and into it he brought
his bride, Miss Phebe Bliss (daughter of
Rev. Daniel Bliss, of Concord, and Phebe
Walker, of Connecticut). Miss Mary Emerson,
youngest child of this marriage, used
to say "she was in arms at the battle of
Concord," because her mother held her up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
then two years old, to see the soldiers from
her window; and from his study window
her father saw the fight at the bridge. It
was the scene of many of the anecdotes,
told of Dr. Ripley, some of which, gathered
from various sources, may here be given; it
was also, after his death, one of the resorts
of Thoreau, of Margaret Fuller, of Ellery
Channing, of Dr. Hedge, and of the Transcendentalists
in general. His parishioners
to this day associate Dr. Ripley's form "with
whatever was grave and droll in the old,
cold, unpainted, uncarpeted, square-pewed
meeting-house, with its four iron-gray deacons
in their little box under the pulpit;
with Watts's hymns; with long prayers,
rich with the diction of ages; and, not less,
with the report like musketry from the
movable seats."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> One of these "iron-gray
deacons," Francis Jarvis, used to visit the
Old Manse with his children on Sunday
evenings, and his son, Dr. Edward Jarvis,
thus describes another side of Dr. Ripley's
pastoral character:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Among the very pleasant things connected
with the Sabbaths in the Jarvis family were the
visits to Dr. Ripley in the evening. The doctor
had usually a small levee of such friends as were
disposed to call. Deacon Jarvis was fond of going
there, and generally took with him one of the
children and his wife, when she was able. There
were at these levees many of the most intelligent
and agreeable men of the town,&mdash;Mr. Samuel
Hoar, Mr. Nathan Brooks, Mr. John Keyes,
Deacon Brown, Mr. Pritchard, Major Burr, etc.
These were extremely pleasant gatherings. The
little boys sat and listened, and remembered the
cheerful and instructive conversation. There
were discussions of religion and morals, of politics
and philosophy, the affairs of the town, the
news of the day, the religious and social gossip,
pleasant anecdotes and witty tales. All were in
their best humor. Deacon Jarvis [adds his son],
did not go to these levees every Sunday night,
though he would have been glad to do so, had he
been less distrustful. When his children, who
had no such scruples, asked him to go and take
them with him, he said he feared that Dr. Ripley
would not like to see him so frequently."</p></div>

<p>According to Mr. Emerson, Dr. Ripley
was "a natural gentleman; no dandy, but
courtly, hospitable, and public spirited; his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
house open to all men." An old farmer
who used to travel thitherward from Maine,
where Dr. Ripley had a brother settled in
the ministry, used to say that "no horse
from the Eastern country would go by the
doctor's gate." It was one of the listeners
at his Sunday evening levees, no doubt,
who said (at the time when Dr. Ripley was
preparing for his first and last journey to
Baltimore and Washington, in the presidency
of the younger Adams) "that a man
who could tell a story so well was company
for kings and for John Quincy Adams."</p>

<p>When P. M., after his release from the
State Prison, had the effrontery to call on
Dr. Ripley, as an old acquaintance, as they
were talking together on general matters,
his young colleague, Rev. Mr. Frost, came
in. The doctor presently said, "Mr. M.,
my brother and colleague, Mr. Frost, has
come to take tea with me. I regret very
much the causes (very well known to you),
which make it impossible for me to ask you
to stay and break bread with us." Mr.
Emerson, his grandson (by Dr. Ripley's
marriage with the widow of Rev. William
Emerson) relates that he once went to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
funeral with Dr. Ripley, and heard him address
the mourners. As they approached
the farm-house the old minister said that
the eldest son, who was now to succeed the
deceased father of a family in his place as
a Concord yeoman, was in some danger of
becoming intemperate. In his remarks to
this son, he presently said,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Sir, I condole with you. I knew your great-grandfather;
when I came to this town, in 1778,
he was a substantial farmer in this very place,
a member of the church, and an excellent citizen.
Your grandfather followed him, and was
a virtuous man. Now your father is to be carried
to his grave, full of labors and virtues.
There is none of that old family left but you,
and it rests with you to bear up the good name
and usefulness of your ancestors. If <em>you</em> fail&mdash;Ichabod!&mdash;the
glory is departed. Let us pray."</p></div>

<p>He took Mr. Emerson about with him in
his chaise when a boy, and in passing each
house he would tell the story of its family,
dwelling especially on the nine church-members
who had made a division in the
church in the time of his predecessor; every
one of the nine having come to bad fortune
or a bad end. "The late Dr. Gardiner,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
says Mr. Emerson, "in a funeral sermon
on some parishioner, whose virtues did not
readily come to mind, honestly said, 'He
was good at fires.' Dr. Ripley had many
virtues, and yet, even in his old age, if the
firebell was rung, he was instantly on horseback,
with his buckets and bag." He had
even some willingness, perhaps not equal to
the zeal of the Hindoo saint, to extinguish
the Orthodox fires of hell, which had long
blazed in New England,&mdash;so that men might
worship God with less fear. But he had
small sympathy with the Transcendentalists
when they began to appear in Concord.
When Mr. Emerson took his friend Mr. Alcott
to see the old doctor, he gave him
warning that his brilliant young kinsman
was not quite sound in the faith, and bore
testimony in particular against a sect of his
own naming, called "Egomites" (from <em>ego</em>
and <em>mitto</em>), who "sent themselves" on the
Lord's errands without any due call thereto.
Dr. Channing viewed the "apostles of the
newness" with more favor, and could pardon
something to the spirit of liberty which
was strong in them. The occasional correspondence
between the Concord shepherd of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
his people and the great Unitarian preacher
is full of interest. In February, 1839,
when he was eighty-eight years old and
weighed down with infirmities, he could
still lift up his voice in testimony. He
then wrote to Dr. Channing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Broken down with the infirmities of age, and
subject to fits that deprive me of reason and the
use of my limbs, I feel it a duty to be patient
and submissive to the will of God, who is too
wise to err, and too good to injure. My mind
labors and is oppressed, viewing the present state
of Christianity, and the various speculations,
opinions, and practices of the passing period.
Extremes appear to be sought and loved, and
their novelty gains attention. You, sir, appear
to retain and act upon the sentiment of the Latin
phrase,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"'Est modus in rebus, sunt certi denique fines.'<br />
</p>

<p>"The learned and estimable Norton appears
to me to have weakened his hold on public opinion
and confidence by his petulance or pride, his
want of candor and charity."</p></div>

<p>Six years earlier, Dr. Channing had written
to Dr. Ripley almost as if replying to
some compliment like this, and expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
himself thus, in a letter dated January 22,
1833,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I thank God for the testimony which you
have borne to the usefulness of my writings.
Such approbation from one whom I so much
venerate, and who understands so well the wants
and signs of the times, is very encouraging to
me. If I have done anything towards manifesting
Christianity in its simple majesty and mild
glory I rejoice, and I am happy to have contributed
anything towards the satisfaction of your last
years. It would gratify many, and would do
good, if, in the quiet of your advanced age, you
would look back on the eventful period through
which you have passed, and would leave behind
you, or give now, a record of the changes you
have witnessed, and especially of the progress of
liberal inquiry and rational views in religion."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p></div>

<p>Dr. Ripley's prayers were precise and undoubting
in their appeal for present providences.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
He prayed for rain and against the
lightning, "that it may not lick up our
spirits;" he blessed the Lord for exemption
from sickness and insanity,&mdash;"that
we have not been tossed to and fro until
the dawning of the day, that we have not
been a terror to ourselves and to others."
One memorable occasion, in the later years
of his pastorate, when he had consented to
take a young colleague, is often remembered
in his parish, now fifty years after its date.
The town was suffering from drought, and
the farmers from Barrett's Mill, Bateman's
Pond, and the Nine-Acre Corner had asked
the minister to pray for rain. Mr. Goodwin
(the father of Professor Goodwin, of
Harvard University) had omitted to do this
in his morning service, and at the noon intermission
Dr. Ripley was reminded of the
emergency by the afflicted farmers. He
told them courteously that Mr. Goodwin's
garden lay on the river, and perhaps he had
not noticed how parched the uplands were;
but he entered the pulpit that afternoon
with an air of resolution and command.
Mr. Goodwin, as usual, offered to relieve
the doctor of the duty of leading in prayer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
but the old shepherd, as Mr. Emerson says,
"rejected his offer with some humor, and
with an air that said to all the congregation,
'This is no time for you young Cambridge
men; the affair, sir, is getting serious;
I will pray myself.'" He did so,
and with unusual fervor demanded rain for
the languishing corn and the dry grass of
the field. As the story goes, the afternoon
opened fair and hot, but before the dwellers
in Nine-Acre Corner and the North Quarter
reached their homes a pouring shower
rewarded the gray-haired suppliant, and reminded
Concord that the righteous are not
forsaken. Another of Mr. Emerson's anecdotes
bears on this point:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"One August afternoon, when I was in his hayfield,
helping him, with his man, to rake up his
hay, I well remember his pleading, almost reproachful
looks at the sky, when the thunder-gust
was coming up to spoil his hay. He raked
very fast, then looked at the cloud, and said,
'We are in the Lord's hand,&mdash;mind your rake,
George! we are in the Lord's hand;' and seemed
to say, 'You know me; this field is mine,&mdash;Dr.
Ripley's, thine own servant.'"</p></div>

<p>In his later years Dr. Ripley was much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
distressed by a schism in his church, which
drew off to a Trinitarian congregation several
of his oldest friends and parishioners.
Among the younger members who thus seceded,
seventy years ago, were the maiden
aunts of Thoreau, Jane and Maria,&mdash;the
last of whom, and the last of the name in
America, has died recently, as already mentioned.
Thoreau seceded later, but not to
the "Orthodox" church,&mdash;as much against
the wish of Dr. Ripley, however, as if he
had. In later years, Thoreau's church (of
the Sunday Walkers) was recognized in the
village gossip; so that when I first spent
Sunday in Concord, and asked my landlord
what churches there were, he replied, "The
Unitarian, the Orthodox, and the Walden
Pond Association." To the latter he professed
to belong, and said its services consisted
in walking on Sunday in the Walden
woods. Dr. Ripley would have viewed such
rites with horror, but they have now become
common. His Old Manse, which
from 1842 to 1846 was occupied by Hawthorne,
was for twenty years (1847-1867)
the home of Mrs. Sarah Ripley, that sweet
and learned lady, and has since been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
dwelling-place of her children, the grandchildren
of Dr. Ripley. Near by stands now
the statue of the Concord Minute-Man of
1775, marking the spot to which the Middlesex
farmers came</p>

<p class="center">
"In sloven dress and broken rank,"<br />
</p>

<p>and where they stood when in unconscious
heroism they</p>

<p class="center">
"Fired the shot heard round the world,"<br />
</p>

<p>and drove back the invading visitor from
their doorsteps and cornfields.</p>

<p>Dr. Ripley, however, seldom repelled a
visitor or an invader, unless he came from
too recent an experience in the state prison,
or offered to "break out" his path on a
Sunday, when he had fancied himself too
much snow-bound to go forth to his pulpit.
The anecdote is characteristic, if not wholly
authentic. One Sunday, after a severe
snow-storm, his neighbor, the great farmer
on Ponkawtassett Hill, half a mile to the
northward of the Old Manse, turned out
his ox-teams and all his men and neighbors
to break a path to the meeting-house and
the tavern. Wallowing through the drifts,
they had got as far as Dr. Ripley's gate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
while the good parson, snugly blocked in
by a drift completely filling his avenue of
ash-trees, thought of nothing less than of
going out to preach that day. The long
team of oxen, with much shouting and
stammering from the red-faced farmer, was
turned out of the road and headed up the
avenue, when Dr. Ripley, coming to his
parsonage door, and commanding silence,
began to berate Captain B. for breaking the
Sabbath and the roads at one stroke,&mdash;implying,
if not asserting, that he did it to
save time and oxen for his Monday's work.
Angered at the ingratitude of his minister,
the stammering farmer turned the ten yoke
of cattle round in the doctor's garden, and
drove on to the village, leaving the parson
to shovel himself out and get to meeting
the best way he could. Meanwhile, the
teamsters sat in the warm bar-room at the
tavern, and cheered themselves with punch,
flip, grog, and toddy, instead of going to
hear Dr. Ripley hold forth; and when he
had returned to his parsonage they paraded
their oxen and sleds back again, past his
gate, with much more shouting than at
first. This led to a long quarrel between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
minister and parishioner, in course of which,
one day, as the doctor halted his chaise in
front of the farmer's house on the hill, the
stammering captain came forward, a peck
measure in his hand, with which he had
been giving his oxen their meal, and began
to renew the unutterable grievance. Waxing
warm, as the doctor admonished him
afresh, he smote with his wooden measure
on the shafts of the chaise, until his gentle
wife, rushing forth, called on the neighbors
to stop the fight which she fancied was
going on between the charioteer of the Lord
and the foot-soldier.</p>

<p>Despite these outbursts, and his habitual
way of looking at all things "from the
parochial point of view," as Emerson said
of him, he was also a courteous and liberal-minded
man, as the best anecdotes of him
constantly prove. He was the sovereign of
his people, managing the church, the schools,
the society meetings, and, for a time, the
Lyceum, as he thought fit. The lecturers,
as well as the young candidates for school-keeping&mdash;Theodore
Parker, Edward Everett,
and the rest&mdash;addressed themselves to
him, and when he met Webster, then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
great man of Massachusetts, it was on equal
terms.</p>

<p>Daniel Webster was never a lyceum lecturer
in Concord, and he did not often try
cases there, but was sometimes consulted
in causes of some pecuniary magnitude.
When Humphrey Barrett died (whose management
of his nephew's estate will be
mentioned in the next chapter), his heir
by will (a young man without property,
until he should inherit the large estate bequeathed
him), found it necessary to employ
counsel against the heirs-at-law, who sought
to break the will. His attorney went to
Mr. Webster in Boston and related the
facts, adding that his client could not then
pay a large fee, but might, if the cause were
gained, as Mr. Webster thought it would
be. "You may give me one hundred dollars
as a retainer," said Webster, "and tell the
young man, from me, that when I win his
case I shall send him a bill that will make
his hair stand on end." It so happened,
however, that Webster was sent to the Senate,
and the case was won by his partner.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1843, while Thoreau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
was living at Staten Island, Webster visited
Concord to try an important case in the
county court, which then held sessions
there. This was the "Wyman Trial,"
long famous in local traditions, Webster
and Choate being both engaged in the case,
and along with them Mr. Franklin Dexter
and Mr. Rockwood Hoar, the latter a
young lawyer, who had been practicing in
the Middlesex courts for a few years, where
his father, Mr. Samuel Hoar, was the leader
of the bar. Judge Allen (Charles Allen of
Worcester) held the court, and the eminent
array of counsel just named was for the defense.</p>

<p>The occasion was a brilliant one, and
made a great and lasting sensation in the
village. Mr. Webster and his friends were
entertained at the houses of the chief men
of Concord, and the villagers crowded the
court-house to hear the arguments and the
colloquies between the counsel and the
court. Webster was suffering from his
usual summer annoyance, the "hay catarrh,"
or "rose cold," which he humorously
described afterward in a letter to a
friend in Concord:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"You know enough of my miserable catarrh.
Its history, since I left your hospitable roof, is
not worth noting. There would be nothing
found in it, either of the sublime or the beautiful;
nothing fit for elegant description or a touch
of sentiment. Not that it has not been a great
thing in its way; for I think the <em>sneezing</em> it has
occasioned has been truly transcendental. A
fellow-sufferer from the same affliction, who lived
in Cohasset, was asked, the other day, what in
the world he took for it? His reply was that he
'took eight handkerchiefs a day.' And this, I
believe, is the approved mode of treatment;
though the <em>doses</em> here mentioned are too few for
severe cases. Suffice it to say, my dear lady,
that either from a change of air, or the progress
of the season, or, what is more probable, from
the natural progress of the disease itself, I am
much better than when I left Concord, and I
propose to return to Boston to-day, feeling, or
hoping, that I may now be struck off the list of
invalids."</p></div>

<p>Notwithstanding this affliction, Mr. Webster
made himself agreeable to the ladies of
Concord, old and young, and even the little
girls, like Louisa Alcott, went to the courthouse
to see and hear him. He was present
at a large tea-party given by Mrs. R. W.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Emerson in his honor, and he renewed his
old acquaintance with the Dunbars and Thoreaus.
Mr. Emerson, writing to Thoreau
September 8, 1843, said, briefly, "You will
have heard of our 'Wyman Trial,' and the
stir it made in the village. But the Cliff
and Walden, which know something of the
railroad, knew nothing of that; not a leaf
nodded; not a pebble fell;&mdash;why should I
speak of it to you?" Thoreau was indeed
interested in it, and in the striking personality
of Webster. To his mother he wrote
from Staten Island (August 29, 1843):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I should have liked to see Daniel Webster
walking about Concord; I suppose the town
shook, every step he took. But I trust there
were some sturdy Concordians who were not
tumbled down by the jar, but represented still
the upright town. Where was George Minott?
he would not have gone far to see him. Uncle
Charles should have been there;&mdash;he might as
well have been catching cat-naps in Concord as
anywhere. And, then, what a whetter-up of his
memory this event would have been! You'd
have had all the classmates again in alphabetical
order reversed,&mdash;'and Seth Hunt and Bob
Smith&mdash;and he was a student of my father's&mdash;and
where's Put now? and I wonder&mdash;you&mdash;if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Henry's been to see George Jones yet? A
little account with Stow&mdash;Balcolm&mdash;Bigelow&mdash;poor,
miserable t-o-a-d (sound asleep). I vow&mdash;you&mdash;what
noise was that? saving grace&mdash;and
few there be. That's clear as preaching&mdash;Easter
Brooks&mdash;morally depraved&mdash;how charming
is divine philosophy&mdash;somewise and some
otherwise&mdash;Heighho! (Sound asleep again.)
Webster's a smart fellow&mdash;bears his age well.
How old should you think he was? you&mdash;does
he look as if he were two years younger than I?'"</p></div>

<p>This uncle was Charles Dunbar, of course,
who was in fact two years older than Webster,
and, like him, a New Hampshire man.
He and his sisters&mdash;the mother and the
aunt of Henry Thoreau&mdash;had known Webster
in his youth, when he was a poor
young lawyer in New Hampshire; and the
acquaintance was kept up from time to
time as the years brought them together.
Whenever Webster passed a day in Concord,
as he did nearly every year from
1843 to 1850, he would either call on Miss
Dunbar, or she would meet him at tea in
the house of Mr. Cheney, a college classmate
of Mr. Emerson, whom he usually visited;
and whose garden was a lovely plot, ornamented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
with great elm trees, on the bank
of the Musketaquid. Mrs. Thoreau was
often included in these friendly visits; and
it was of this family, as well as of the Emersons,
Hoars, and Brookses, no doubt, that
Webster was thinking when he sadly wrote
to Mrs. Cheney his last letter, less than a
year before his death in 1852. In this
note, dated at Washington, November 1,
1851, when he was Secretary of State under
Fillmore, Mr. Webster said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have very much wished to see you all, and
in the early part of October seriously contemplated
going to Concord for a day. But I was
hindered by circumstances, and partly deterred
also by changes which have taken place. My
valued friend, Mr. Phinney (of Lexington), is
not living; and many of those whom I so highly
esteemed, in your beautiful and quiet village,
have become a good deal estranged, to my great
grief, by abolitionism, free-soilism, transcendentalism,
and other notions, which I cannot (but)
regard as so many vagaries of the imagination.
These former warm friends would have no pleasure,
of course, in intercourse with one of old-fashioned
opinions. Nevertheless, dear Mrs. Cheney,
if I live to see another summer, I will make
a visit to your house, and talk about former
times and former things."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>He never came; for in June, 1852, the
Whig convention at Baltimore rejected his
name as a Presidential candidate, and he
went home to Marshfield to die. The tone
of sadness in this note was due, in part,
perhaps, to the eloquent denunciation of
Webster by Mr. Emerson in a speech at
Cambridge in 1851, and to the unequivocal
aversion with which Webster's contemporary,
the first citizen of Concord, Samuel
Hoar, spoke of his 7th of March speech, and
the whole policy with which Webster had
identified himself in those dreary last years
of his life. Mr. Hoar had been sent by his
State in 1846 to protest in South Carolina
against the unconstitutional imprisonment
at Charleston of colored seamen from Massachusetts;
and he had been driven by
force from the State to which he went as an
envoy. But, although Webster knew the
gross indignity of the act, and introduced
into his written speech in March, 1850, a
denunciation of it, he did not speak this
out in the Senate, nor did it appear in all
the authorized editions of the speech. He
could hardly expect Mr. Hoar to welcome
him in Concord after he had uttered his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
willingness to return fugitive slaves, but
forgot to claim reparation for so shameful
an affront to Massachusetts as the Concord
Cato had endured.</p>

<p>Mr. Webster was attached to Concord&mdash;as
most persons are who have ever spent
pleasant days there&mdash;and used to compliment
his friend on his house and garden by
the river side. Looking out upon his great
trees from the dining-room window, he
once said: "I am in the terrestrial paradise,
and I will prove it to you by this.
America is the finest continent on the globe,
the United States the finest country in
America, Massachusetts the best State in
the Union, Concord the best town in Massachusetts,
and my friend Cheney's field the
best acre in Concord." This was an opinion
so like that often expressed by Henry
Thoreau, that one is struck by it. Indeed,
the devotion of Thoreau to his native town
was so marked as to provoke opposition.
"Henry talks about Nature," said Madam
Hoar (the mother of Senator Hoar, and
daughter of Roger Sherman of Connecticut),
"just as if she'd been born and brought up
in Concord."</p>

THE EMBATTLED FARMERS.</h2>


<p>It was not the famous lawyers, the godly
ministers, the wealthy citizens, nor even the
learned ladies of Concord, who interested
Henry Thoreau specially,&mdash;but the sturdy
farmers, each on his hereditary acres, battling
with the elements and enjoying that
open-air life which to Thoreau was the only
existence worth having. As his best biographer,
Ellery Channing, says: "He came
to see the inside of every farmer's house
and head, his pot of beans, and mug of hard
cider. Never in too much hurry for a dish
of gossip, he could sit out the oldest frequenter
of the bar-room, and was alive from
top to toe with curiosity."</p>

<p>Concord, in our day, and still more in
Thoreau's childhood, was dotted with frequent
old farm-houses, of the ample and
picturesque kind that bespeaks antiquity
and hospitality. In one such he was born,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
though not one of the oldest or the best.
He was present at the downfall of several
of these ancient homesteads, in whose date
and in the fortunes of their owners for successive
generations, he took a deep interest;
and still more in their abandoned orchards
and door-yards, where the wild apple tree
and the vivacious lilac still flourished.</p>

<p>To show what sort of men these Concord
farmers were in the days when their historical
shot was fired, let me give some anecdotes
and particulars concerning two of
the original family stocks,&mdash;the Hosmers,
who first settled in Concord in 1635, with
Bulkeley and Willard, the founders of the
town; and the Barretts, whose first ancestor,
Humphrey Barrett, came over in 1639.
James Hosmer, a clothier from Hawkhurst
in Kent, with his wife Ann (related to Major
Simon Willard, that stout Kentishman,
Indian trader and Indian fighter, who bought
of the Squaw Sachem the township of Concord,
six miles square), two infant daughters,
and two maid-servants, came from
London to Boston in the ship "Elizabeth,"
and the next year built a house on Concord
Street, and a mill on the town brook.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
From him descended James Hosmer, who
was killed at Sudbury in 1658, in an Indian
fight, Stephen, his great-grandson, a famous
surveyor, and Joseph, his great-great-grandson,
one of the promoters of the Revolution,
who had a share in its first fight at
Concord Bridge. Joseph Hosmer was the
son of a Concord farmer, who, in 1743,
seceded from the parish church, because
Rev. Daniel Bliss, the pastor, had said in a
sermon (as his opponents averred), "that it
was as great a sin for a man to get an estate
by honest labor, if he had not a single aim
at the glory of God, as to get it by gaming
at cards or dice." What this great-grandfather
of Emerson did say, a century before
the Transcendental epoch, was this, as he
declared: "If husbandmen plow and sow
that they may be rich, and live in the pleasures
of this world, and appear grand before
men, they are as far from true religion in
their plowing, sowing, etc., as men are that
game for the same purpose." Thomas Hosmer,
being a prosperous husbandman, perhaps
with a turn for display, took offense,
and became a worshipper at what was called
the "Black Horse Church,"&mdash;a seceding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
conventicle which met at the tavern with
the sign of the Black Horse, near where
the Concord Library now stands. Joseph
Hosmer, his boy, was known at the village
school as "the little black colt,"&mdash;a lad
of adventurous spirit, with dark eyes and
light hair, whose mother, Prudence Hosmer,
would repeat old English poetry until
all her listeners but her son were weary.
When he was thirty-nine years old, married
and settled, a farmer and cabinet-maker,
there was a convention in the parish church
to consider the Boston Port Bill, the doings
of General Gage in Boston, and the advice
of Samuel Adams and John Hancock to resist
oppression. Daniel Bliss, the leading
lawyer and leading Tory in Concord, eldest
son of Parson Bliss, and son-in-law of Colonel
Murray, of Rutland, Vt., the chief
Tory of that region, made a speech in this
convention against the patriotic party. He
was a graceful and fluent speaker, a handsome
man, witty, sarcastic, and popular,
but with much scorn for the plain people.
He painted in effective colors the power
of the mother country and the feebleness
of the colonies; he was elegantly dressed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
friendly in his manner, but discouraging to
the popular heart, and when he sat down, a
deep gloom seemed to settle on the assembly.
His brother-in-law, Parson Emerson,
an ardent patriot, if present, was silent.
From a corner of the meeting-house there
rose at last a man with sparkling eyes,
plainly dressed in butternut brown, who began
to speak in reply to the handsome
young Tory, at first slowly and with hesitation,
but soon taking fire at his own
thoughts, he spoke fluently, in a strain
of natural eloquence, which gained him the
ear and applause of the assembly. A delegate
from Worcester, who sat near Mr.
Bliss, noticed that the Tory was discomposed,
biting his lip, frowning, and pounding
with the heel of his silver-buckled shoe.
"Who is the speaker?" he asked of Bliss.
"Hosmer, a Concord mechanic," was the
scornful reply. "Then how does he come
by his English?" "Oh, he has an old
mother at home, who sits in her chimney-corner
and reads and repeats poetry all day
long;" adding in a moment, "He is the
most dangerous rebel in Concord, for he
has all the young men at his back, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
where he leads the way they will surely
follow."</p>

<p>Four months later, in April, 1775, this
Concord mechanic made good the words of
his Tory townsman, for it was his speech to
the minute-men which goaded them on to
the fight. After forming the regiment as
adjutant, he addressed them, closing with
these words: "I have often heard it said
that the British boasted they could march
through our country, laying waste every
village and neighborhood, and that we
would not dare oppose them,&mdash;<em>and I begin
to believe it is true</em>." Then turning to
Major Buttrick, who commanded, and looking
off from the hill-side to the village, from
which a thick smoke was rising, he cried,
"Will you let them burn the town down?"
whereupon the sturdy major, who had no
such intention, ordered his men to march;
and when, a few minutes later, the British
fired on his column of companies, the Acton
men at the head, he sprang from the ground
shouting, "Fire, fellow-soldiers, for God's
sake fire!" and discharged his own piece
at the same instant. The story has often
been told, but will bear repetition. Thoreau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
heard it in 1835 from the lips of Emerson,
as he pronounced the centennial discourse
in honor of the town's settlement
and history; but he had read it and heard
it a hundred times before, from his earliest
childhood. Mr. Emerson added, after describing
the fight:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"These poor farmers who came up, that day,
to defend their native soil, acted from the simplest
instincts; they did not know it was a deed
of fame they were doing. These men did not
babble of glory; they never dreamed their children
would contend which had done the most.
They supposed they had a right to their corn and
their cattle, without paying tribute to any but
their own governors. And as they had no fear
of man, they yet did have a fear of God. Captain
Charles Miles, who was wounded in the pursuit
of the enemy, told my venerable friend (Dr.
Ripley), who sits by me, 'that he went to the
services of that day with the same seriousness
and acknowledgment of God, which he carried to
church.'"</p></div>

<p>Humphrey Barrett, fifth in descent from
the original settler, was born in 1752, on
the farm his ancestors had owned ever since
1640, and was no doubt in arms at Concord
Fight in 1775. His biographer says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Some persons slightly acquainted with him
in the latter part of his life, judged him to be unsocial,
cold, and indifferent, but those most acquainted
with him knew him to be precisely the
reverse. The following acts of his life make apparent
some traits of his character. A negro, by
the name of Cæsar Robbins, had been in the habit
of getting all the wood for his family use for
many years from Mr. Barrett's wood-lot near by
him; this being done with the knowledge and
with the implied if not the express consent of the
owner. Mr. Barrett usually got the wood for
his own use from another part of his farm; but
on one occasion he thought he would get it from
the lot by Cæsar's. He accordingly sent two
men with two teams, with directions to cut only
hard wood. The men had been gone but a few
hours when Cæsar came to Mr. Barrett's house,
his face covered with sweat, and in great agitation,
and says, 'Master Barrett, I have come to
let you know that a parcel of men and teams
have broke into our wood-lot, and are making
terrible destruction of the very best trees, and
unless we do something immediately I shall be
ruined.' Mr. Barrett had no heart to resist this
appeal of Cæsar's; he told him not to be alarmed,
for he would see that he was not hurt, and would
put the matter right. He then wrote an order
to his men to cut no more wood, but to come directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
home with their teams, and sent the order
by Cæsar."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p></div>

<p>The biographer of Mr. Barrett, who was
also his attorney and legal adviser, goes on
to say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A favorite nephew who bore his name, and
whose guardian he was, died under age in 1818,
leaving a large estate, and no relatives nearer
than uncle and aunt and the children of deceased
aunts. Mr. Barrett believed that the
estate in equity ought to be distributed equally
between the uncle and aunt and the children
of deceased aunts by right of representation.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
And although advised that such was not the
law, he still insisted upon having the question
carried before the Supreme Court for decision;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
and when the court decided against his opinion,
he carried out his own views of equity by distributing
the portion that fell to him according to
his opinion of what the law ought to be. After
he had been fully advised that the estate would
be distributed in a manner he thought neither
equitable nor just, he applied to the writer to
make out his account as guardian; furnishing the
evidence, as he believed, of the original amount
of all his receipts as such guardian. I made the
account, charging him with interest at six per
cent. on all sums from the time of receipt till the
time of making the account. Mr. Barrett took
the account for examination, and soon returned
it with directions to charge him with compound
interest, saying that he believed he had realized
as much as that. I accordingly made the account
conform to his directions. He then wished me
to present this account to the party who claimed
half the estate, and ask him to examine it with
care and see if anything was omitted. This was
done, and no material omission discovered, and
no objection made. Mr. Barrett then said that
he had always kept all the property of his
ward in a drawer appropriated for the purpose;
that he made the amount of property in the
drawer greater than the balance of the account;
and (handing to me the contents of the drawer)
he wished me to ascertain the precise sum to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
which it amounted. I found that it exceeded the
balance of the account by $3,221.59. He then
told me, in substance, that he was quite unwilling
to have so large an amount of property go where
it was in danger of being distributed inequitably,
and particularly as he was confident he had disclosed
every source from which he had realized
any property of his ward, and also the actual
amount received; <em>but</em>, as he knew not how it got
into the drawer, and had intended all the property
there to go to his nephew, he should not feel
right to retain it, and therefore directed me to
add it to the amount of the estate,&mdash;which was
done."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p></div>

<p>Conceive a community in which such characters
were common, and imagine whether
the claim of King George and the fine gentlemen
about him, to tax the Americans
without their own consent would be likely to
succeed! I find in obscure anecdotes like
this sufficient evidence that if John Hampden
had emigrated to Massachusetts when
he had it in mind, he would have found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
men like himself tilling their own acres in
Concord. The Barretts, from their name,
may have been Normans, but, like Hampden,
the Hosmers were Saxons, and held
land in England before William the Conqueror.
When Major Hosmer, who was
adjutant, and formed the line of the regiment
that returned the British fire at
Concord Bridge, had an estate to settle
about 1785, the heir to which was supposed
to be in England, he employed an agent,
who was then visiting London, to notify the
heir, and also desired him to go to the
Heralds' Office and ascertain what coat-of-arms
belonged to any branch of the Hosmer
family. When the agent (who may have
been Mr. Tilly Merrick, of Concord, John
Adams's attaché in Holland), returned to
America, after reporting his more important
business to Major Hosmer, he added,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I called at the Heralds' Office in London,
and the clerk said, '<em>There was no coat-of-arms
for you, and, if you were an Englishman you
would not want one; for</em> (he said) <em>there were Hosmers
in Kent long before the Conquest; and at the
battle of Hastings, the men of Kent were the vanguard
of King Harold</em>.'"</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>If Major Hosmer's ancestors failed to
drive back the invaders then, their descendants
made good the failure in Concord seven
centuries later.</p>

<p>Thoreau's favorite walk, as he tells us,&mdash;the
pathway toward Heaven,&mdash;was along
the old Marlborough road, west and southwest
from Concord village, through deep
woods in Concord and in Sudbury. To
reach this road he passed by the great Hosmer
farm-house, built by the old major
already mentioned, in 1760 or thereabout,
and concerning which there is a pretty
legend that Thoreau may have taken with
him along the Marlborough road. In 1758,
young Jo. Hosmer, "the little black colt,"
drove to Marlborough one autumn day with
a load of furniture he had made for Jonathan
Barnes, a rich farmer, and town clerk
in thrifty Marlborough. He had received
the money for his furniture, and was standing
on the doorstep, preparing to go home,
when a young girl, Lucy Barnes, the daughter
of the house, ran up to him and said,
"Concord woods are dark, and a thunderstorm
is coming up; you had better stay
all night." "Since you ask me, I will,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
was the reply, and the visit was often repeated
in the next few months. But when
he asked farmer Jonathan for his daughter,
the reply was,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Concord plains are barren soil. Lucy had
better marry her cousin John, whose father will
give him one of the best farms in Marlborough,
with a good house on it, and Lucy can match
his land acre for acre."</p></div>

<p>Joseph returned from that land of Egypt,
and like a wise youth took the hint, and
built a house of his own, planting the elm
trees that now overshadow it, after a hundred
and twenty years. After the due interval
he went again to Marlborough, and
found Lucy Barnes in the September sunshine,
gathering St. Michael's pears in her
father's garden. Cousin John was married,
by this time, to another damsel. Miss Lucy
was bent on having her own way and her
own Joseph; and so Mr. Barnes gave his
consent. They were married at Christmas,
1761; and Lucy came home behind him on
his horse, through the same Concord woods.
She afterwards told her youngest son, with
some pique:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>"When my brother Jonathan was married, and
went to New Hampshire, twenty couples on
horseback followed them to Haverhill, on the
Merrimac, but when your father and I were
married, we came home alone through these dark
Concord woods."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p></div>

<p>The son of this lively Lucy Hosmer, Rufus
Hosmer, of Stow, was a classmate, at Cambridge,
of Washington Allston, the late
Chief Justice Shaw, and Dr. Charles Lowell,
father of Lowell the poet. They graduated
in 1798, and Dr. Lowell afterwards
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I can recall with peculiar pleasure a vacation
passed in Concord in my senior year, which
Loammi Baldwin, Lemuel Shaw, Washington
Allston, and myself spent with Rufus Hosmer at
his father's house. I recall the benign face of
Major Hosmer, as he stood in the door to receive
us, with his handsome daughter-in-law (the wife
of Capt. Cyrus Hosmer) on his arm. There
was a charming circle of young people then living
in Concord, and we boys enjoyed this very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
much; but we liked best of all to stay at home
and listen to the Major's stories. It was very
pleasant to have a rainy day come for this, and
hard to tell which seemed the happier, he or we."</p></div>

<p>Forty years afterward, in 1838, Dr. Lowell's
son, James Russell Lowell, coming
under college discipline, was sent to Concord
to spend a similar summer vacation,
and wrote his class poem in that town.</p>

<p>Major Hosmer died in 1821, at the age
of eighty-five. Mr. Samuel Hoar, long the
leader of the Middlesex County bar, who
knew him in his later life, once said,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In two respects he excelled any one I have
ever known; he was more entirely free from
prejudice, and also the best reader of men. So
clear was his mind and so strong his reasoning
power, that I would have defied the most eloquent
pleader at the bar to have puzzled him, no
matter how skillfully he concealed the weak
points of the case. I can imagine him listening
quietly, and saying in his slow way, 'It's a pity
so many fine words should be wasted, for, you
see, the man's on the wrong side.'"</p></div>

<p>Another old lawyer of Concord, who
first saw Major Hosmer when he was a
child of ten, and the Major was sixty years
old, said,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I then formed an opinion of him in two respects
that I never altered: First, that he had
the handsomest eyes I ever saw; second, those
eyes saw the inside of my head as clearly as they
did the outside."</p></div>

<p>He was for many years sheriff of the
county, and it was the habit of the young
lawyers in term-time to get round his chair
and ask his opinion about their cases. Such
was his knowledge of the common law, and
so well did he know the judges and jurymen,
that when he said to Mr. Hoar, "I
fear you will lose your case," that gentleman
said, "from that moment I felt it lost,
for I never knew him to make a wrong
guess." He was a Federalist of the old
school, and in his eyes Alexander Hamilton
was the first man in America. His son
held much the same opinion of Daniel
Webster.</p>

<p>Near by Major Hosmer's farm-house
stood the old homestead and extensive farm
buildings of the Lee family, who at the beginning
of the Revolution owned one of the
two or three great farms in Concord. This
estate has been owned and sold in one parcel
of about four hundred acres ever since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
it was first occupied by Henry Woodhouse
about 1650. It lies between the two rivers
Assabet and Musketaquid, and includes
Nahshawtuc, or Lee's Hill, on which, in
early days, was an Indian village. The
Lees inherited it from the original owner,
and held it for more than one hundred
years, though it narrowly escaped confiscation
in 1775, its owner being a Tory.
Early in the present century it fell, by
means of a mortgage, into the hands of
"old Billy Gray" (the founder of the fortunes
that for two or three generations have
been held in the Gray family of Boston),
was by him sold to Judge Fay, of Cambridge,
and by him, in 1822, conveyed to
his brother-in-law, Joseph Barrett, of Concord,
a distant cousin of the Humphrey
Barrett, mentioned elsewhere. Joseph Barrett
had been one of Major Hosmer's deputies,
when the old yeoman was sheriff, but
now turned his attention to farming his
many acres, and deserves mention here as
one of the Concord farmers of two generations
after the battle, among whom Henry
Thoreau grew up. Indeed, the Lee Farm
was one of his most accustomed haunts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
since the river flowed round it for a mile
or two, and its commanding hill-top gave
a prospect toward the western and northwestern
mountains, Wachusett and Monadnoc
chief among the beautiful brotherhood,
whom Thoreau early saluted with a dithyrambic
verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"With frontier strength ye stand your ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With grand content ye circle round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Tumultuous silence for all sound),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye distant nursery of rills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Monadnoc and the Peterboro hills;<br /></span>

<span class="i8">. . . .<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But special I remember thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wachusett, who, like me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Standest alone without society;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy far blue eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A remnant of the sky."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Lee's Hill (which must be distinguished
from Lee's Cliff, three miles further up the
main river), was the centre of this farm,
and almost of the township itself, and Squire
Barrett, while he tilled its broad acres (or
left them untilled), might be called the
centre of the farmers of his county. He
was for some years president of the Middlesex
Agricultural Society (before which,
in later years, Emerson, and Thoreau, and
Agassiz gave addresses), and took the prize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
in the plowing-match at its October cattle-show,
holding his own plow, and driving
his oxen himself. Descending from the
committee-room in dress coat and ruffled
shirt, he found his plow-team waiting for
him, but his rivals in the match already
turning their furrows. Laying off his coat,
and fortifying himself with a pinch of maccaboy,
while, as his teamster vowed, "that
nigh-ox had his eye on the 'Squire from the
time he hove in sight, ready to start the
minute he took the plow-handles,"&mdash;then
stepping to the task, six feet and one inch
in height, and in weight two hundred and
fifty pounds, the 'Squire began, and before
the field was plowed he had won the premium.
He was one of the many New England
yeomen we have all known, who gave
the lie to the common saying about the sturdier
bulk and sinew of our beer-drinking
cousins across the water. 'Squire Barrett
could lift a barrel of cider into a cart, and
once carried on his shoulders, up two flights
of stairs, a sack containing eight bushels of
Indian corn, which must have weighed more
than four hundred pounds. He was a good
horseman, an accomplished dancer, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
the hayfield excelled in the graceful sweep
of his scythe and the flourish of his pitchfork.</p>

<p>In course of time (1840) Mr. Alcott,
with his wife (a daughter of Colonel May,
of Boston), and those daughters who have
since become celebrated, came to live in the
Hosmer cottage not far from 'Squire Barrett's,
and under the very eaves of Major
Hosmer's farm-house, to which in 1761 came
the fair and willful Lucy Barnes. The
portly and courtly 'Squire, who knew Colonel
May, came to call on his neighbors, and
had many a chat with Mrs. Alcott about her
Boston kindred, the Mays, Sewalls, Salisburys,
etc. His civility was duly returned
by Mrs. Alcott, who, when 'Squire Barrett
was a candidate for State Treasurer in 1845,
was able, by letters to her friends in Boston,
to give him useful support. He was
chosen, and held the office till his death in
1849, when Thoreau had just withdrawn
from his Walden hermitage, and was publishing
his first book, "A Week on the
Concord and Merrimack."</p>

<p>Thoreau's special friend among the farmers
was another character, Edmund Hosmer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
a scion of the same prolific Hosmer
stock, who died in 1881. Edmund Hosmer,
with Mr. Alcott, George Curtis and his
brother Burrill, and other friends, helped
Thoreau raise the timbers of his cabin in
1845, and was often his Sunday visitor in
the hermitage. Of him it is that mention
is made in "Walden," as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"On a Sunday afternoon, if I chanced to be
at home, I heard the crunching of the snow, made
by the step of a long-headed farmer, who from
far through the woods sought my house, to have
a social 'crack;' one of the few of his vocation
who are 'men on their farms;' who donned a
frock instead of a professor's gown, and is as ready
to extract the moral out of church or state as to
haul a load of manure from his barn-yard. We
talked of rude and simple times, when men sat
about large fires in cold, bracing weather, with
clear heads; and when other dessert failed, we
tried our teeth on many a nut which wise squirrels
have long since abandoned,&mdash;for those which
have the thickest shells are commonly empty."</p></div>

<p>Edmund Hosmer, who was a friend of
Mr. Emerson also, and of whom George
Curtis and his brother hired land which
they cultivated for a time, has been celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
in prose and verse by other Concord
authors. I suppose it was he of whom
Emerson wrote thus in his apologue of
Saadi, many years ago:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Said Saadi,&mdash;When I stood before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hassan the camel-driver's door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I scorned the fame of Timour brave,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Timour to Hassan was a slave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In every glance of Hassan's eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I read rich years of victory.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I, who cower mean and small<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the frequent interval<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When wisdom not with me resides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worship Toil's wisdom that abides.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shunned his eyes&mdash;the faithful man's,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shunned the toiling Hassan's glance."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Edmund Hosmer was also, in George
Curtis's description of a conversation at Mr.
Emerson's house in 1845, "the sturdy farmer
neighbor, who had bravely fought his
way through inherited embarrassments to
the small success of a New England husbandman,
and whose faithful wife had seven
times merited well of her country." And
it may be that he was Ellery Channing's</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">"Spicy farming sage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twisted with heat and cold and cramped with age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who grunts at all the sunlight through the year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And springs from bed each morning with a cheer.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of all his neighbors he can something tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis bad, whate'er, we know, and like it well!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bluebird's song he hears the first in spring,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shoots the last goose bound south on freezing wing."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Hosmer might have sat, also, for the more
idyllic picture of the Concord farmer,
which Channing has drawn in his "New
England":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"This man takes pleasure o'er the crackling fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His glittering axe subdued the monarch oak;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He earned the cheerful blaze by something higher<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than pensioned blows.&mdash;he owned the tree he stroke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knows the value of the distant smoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he returns at night, his labor done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Matched in his action with the long day's sun."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Near the small farm of Edmund Hosmer,
when Mr. Curtis lived with him and sometimes
worked on his well-tilled acres, lay
a larger farm, which, about the beginning
of Thoreau's active life, was brought from
neglect and barrenness into high cultivation
by Captain Abel Moore, another Concord
farmer, and one of the first, in this part of
the country, to appreciate the value of our
bog-meadows for cultivation by ditching
and top-dressing with the sand which Nature
had so thoughtfully ridged up in hills
close by. Under the name of "Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Hardy," Emerson celebrated this achievement
of his townsman, upon which the hundreds
who in summer strolled to the School
of Philosophy in Mr. Alcott's orchard, gazed
with admiration,&mdash;bettered as it had been
by the thirty years' toil and skill bestowed
upon it since by Captain Moore's son and
grandson. Emerson said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Look across the fence into Captain Hardy's
land. There's a musician for you who knows
how to make men dance for him in all weathers,&mdash;all
sorts of men,&mdash;Paddies, felons, farmers,
carpenters, painters,&mdash;yes, and trees, and grapes,
and ice, and stone,&mdash;hot days, cold days. Beat
that true Orpheus lyre if you can. He knows
how to make men sow, dig, mow, and lay stone-wall;
to make trees bear fruit God never gave
them, and foreign grapes yield the juices of
France and Spain, on his south side. He saves
every drop of sap, as if it were his blood. See
his cows, his horses, his swine! And he, the
piper that plays the jig they all must dance, biped
and quadruped, is the plainest, stupidest harlequin,
in a coat of no colors. His are the woods,
the waters, hills, and meadows. With one blast
of his pipe he danced a thousand tons of gravel
from yonder blowing sand-heap to the bog-meadow,
where the English grass is waving over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
thirty acres; with another, he winded away sixty
head of cattle in the spring, to the pastures of
Peterboro' on the hills."</p></div>

<p>Such were and are the yeomen of Concord,
among whom Thoreau spent his days,
a friend to them and they to him, though
each sometimes spoke churlishly of the
other. He surveyed their wood-lots, laid
out their roads, measured their fields and
pastures for division among the heirs when
a husbandman died, inspected their rivers
and ponds, and exchanged information
with them concerning the birds, the
beasts, insects, flowers, crops, and trees.
Their yearly Cattle Show in October was
his chief festival,&mdash;one of the things he regretted,
when living on the edge of New
York Bay, and sighing for Fairhaven and
White Pond. Without them the landscape
of his native valley would not have been so
dear to his eyes, and to their humble and
perennial virtues he owed more inspiration
than he would always confess.</p>

<p>He read in the crabbed Latin of those
old Roman farmers, Cato, Varro, and musically-named
Columella, and fancied the
farmers of Concord were daily obeying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Cato's directions, who in turn was but repeating
the maxims of a more remote antiquity.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I see the old, pale-faced farmer walking beside
his team, with contented thoughts," he says,
"for the five thousandth time. This drama every
day in the streets; this is the theatre I go to....
Human life may be transitory and full of
trouble, but the perennial mind, whose survey
extends from that spring to this, from Columella
to Hosmer, is superior to change. I will identify
myself with that which did not die with Columella,
and will not die with Hosmer."</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><small><em>Note.</em>&mdash;The account of "Captain Hardy" was copied
by Channing from Emerson's Journal into the first biography
of Thoreau, without the name of the author; and
so was credited by me to Thoreau in a former edition of
this book.</small></p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a><br /><br />

THE TRANSCENDENTAL PERIOD.</h2>


<p>Although Henry Thoreau would have
been, in any place or time of the world's
drama, a personage of note, it has already
been observed, in regard to his career and his
unique literary gift, that they were affected,
and in some sort fashioned by the influences
of the very time and place in which he
found himself at the opening of life. It was
the sunrise of New England Transcendentalism
in which he first looked upon the
spiritual world; when Carlyle in England,
Alcott, Emerson, and Margaret Fuller in
Massachusetts, were preparing their contemporaries
in America for that modern
Renaissance which has been so fruitful, for
the last forty years, in high thought, vital
religion, pure literature, and great deeds.
And the place of his birth and breeding,
the home of his affections, as it was the
Troy, the Jerusalem, and the Rome of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
imagination, was determined by Providence
to be that very centre and shrine of Transcendentalism,
the little village of Concord,
which would have been saved from oblivion
by his books, had it no other title to remembrance.
Let it be my next effort, then,
to give some hint&mdash;not a brief chronicle&mdash;of
that extraordinary age, not yet ended
(often as they tell us of its death and epitaph),
now known to all men as the Transcendental
Period. We must wait for after-times
to fix its limits and determine its dawn
and setting; but of its apparent beginning
and course, one cycle coincided quite closely
with the life of Thoreau. He was born in
July, 1817, when Emerson was entering
college at Cambridge, and Carlyle was
wrestling "with doubt, fear, unbelief, mockery,
and scoffing, in agony of spirit," at
Edinburgh. He died in May, 1862, when
the distinctly spiritual and literary era
of Transcendentalism had closed, its years
of preparation were over, and it had entered
upon the conflict of political regeneration,
for which Thoreau was constantly
sounding the trumpet. In these forty-five
years,&mdash;a longer period than the age of Pericles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
or of the Medici, or of Queen Elizabeth,&mdash;New
England Transcendentalism
rose, climbed, and culminated, leaving results
that, for our America, must be compared
with those famous eras of civilization.
Those ages, in fact, were well-nigh
lost upon us, until Channing, Emerson, Thoreau,
Margaret Fuller, and their fellowship,
brought us into communication with the
Greek, the Italian, and the noble Elizabethan
revivals of genius and art. We had
been living under the Puritan reaction,
modified and politically fashioned by the
more humane philosophy of the eighteenth
century, while the freedom-breathing, but
half-barbarizing influences of pioneer life in
a new continent, had also turned aside the
full force of English and Scotch Calvinism.</p>

<p>It is common to trace the so-called Transcendentalism
of New England to Carlyle
and Coleridge and Wordsworth in the
mother-country, and to Goethe, Richter, and
Kant in Germany; and there is a certain
outward affiliation of this sort, which cannot
be denied. But that which in our spiritual
soil gave root to the foreign seeds thus
wafted hitherward, was a certain inward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
tendency of high Calvinism and its counterpart,
Quakerism, always welling forth in
the American colonies. Now it inspired
Cotton, Wheelwright, Sir Harry Vane, and
Mistress Anne Hutchinson, in Massachusetts;
now William Penn and his quaint
brotherhood on the Delaware; now Jonathan
Edwards and Sarah Pierpont, in
Connecticut; and, again, John Woolman,
the wandering Friend of God and man, in
New Jersey, Nicholas Gilman, the convert
of Whitefield, in New Hampshire, and Samuel
Hopkins, the preacher of disinterested
benevolence, in Rhode Island, held forth
this noble doctrine of the Inner Light. It
is a gospel peculiarly attractive to poets,
so that even the loose-girt Davenant, who
would fain think himself the left-hand son
of Shakespeare, told gossiping old Aubrey
that he believed the world, after a while,
would settle into one religion, "an ingenious
Quakerism,"&mdash;that is, a faith in divine
communication that would yet leave some
scope for men of wit like himself. How
truly these American Calvinists and Quakers
prefigured the mystical part of Concord

sayings.</p>

<p>Jonathan Edwards, in 1723, when he was
twenty years old, and the fair saint of his
adoration was fifteen, thus wrote in his
diary what he had seen and heard of Sarah
Pierpont:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There is a young lady in New Haven who
is beloved of that Great Being who made and
rules the world; and there are certain seasons
in which this Great Being, in some way or other
invisible, comes to her and fills her mind with
exceeding sweet delight, and she hardly cares for
anything except to meditate on Him. Therefore,
if you present all the world before her, with the
richest of its treasures, she disregards it, and
cares not for it, and is unmindful of any pain or
affliction. She has a strange sweetness in her
mind, and a singular purity in her affections; is
most just and conscientious in all her conduct;
and you could not persuade her to do anything
wrong or sinful, if you would give her all the
world, lest she should offend this Great Being.
She will sometimes go about from place to place
singing sweetly, and seems to be always full of
joy and pleasure, and no one knows for what.
She loves to be alone walking in the fields and
groves, and seems to have some one invisible always
conversing with her."</p></div>

<p>Nicholas Gilman, the parish minister of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
little Durham, in New Hampshire,&mdash;being
under concern of mind for his friend Whitefield,
and the great man of New England,
at that time, Sir William Pepperell, just
setting forth for the capture of Louisburg&mdash;wrote
to them in March, 1745,&mdash;to Sir
William thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Do you indeed love the Lord? do you make
the Lord your Guide and Counselor in ye affair?
If you have a Soul, great as that Hero David of
old, you will ask of the Lord, and not go till he
bid you: David would not. If you are sincerely
desirous to know and do your duty in that and
every other respect, and seek of God in Faith,
you shall know that, and everything else needful,
one thing after another, as fast as you are prepared
for it. But God will, doubtless, humble
such as leave him out of their Schemes, as
though his Providence was not at all concerned
in the matter&mdash;whereas his Blessing is all in
all."</p></div>

<p>To Whitefield, Gilman wrote in the same
vein, on the same day:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Are you sufficiently sure that his call is from
above, that he was moved by the Holy Ghost to
this Expedition? Would it be no advantage to
his Estate to win the place? May he not have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
prospect of doubling his Wealth and Honours, if
crowned with Success? What Demonstration
has he given of being so entirely devoted to the
Lord? He has a vast many Talents,&mdash;is it an
easy thing for so Wise a man to become a Fool
for Christ? so great a man to become a Little
Child? so rich a man to crowd in at the Strait
Gate of Conversion, and make so little noise?...
If you see good to encourage the Expedition,
be fully satisfy'd the project was formed in
Heaven. Was the Lord first consulted in the
affair? Did they wait for his Counsell?"</p></div>

<p>John Woolman, the New Jersey Quaker
(born in 1720, died in 1772), said,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There is a principle which is pure, placed in
the human mind, which, in different places and
ages hath had different names; it is, however,
pure, and proceeds from God. It is deep and
inward, confined to no forms of religion, nor excluded
from any, when the heart stands in perfect
sincerity. In whomsoever this takes root
and grows, they become brethren. That state in
which every motion from the selfish spirit yieldeth
to pure love, I may acknowledge with gratitude
to the Father of Mercies, is often opened
before me as a pearl to seek after."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p></div>

<p>That even the pious egotism and the
laughable vagaries of Transcendentalism
had their prototype in the private meditations
of the New England Calvinists, is well
known to such as have studied old diaries
of the Massachusetts ministers. Thus, a
minister of Malden (a successor of the awful
Michael Wigglesworth, whose alleged
poem, "The Day of Doom," as Cotton
Mather thought, might perhaps "find our
children till the Day itself arrives"), in his
diary for 1735, thus enters his trying experiences
with a "one-horse Shay," whose
short life may claim comparison with that
of the hundred-year master-piece of Dr.
Holmes's deacon:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<em>January 31.</em> Bought a shay for £27 10<em>s.</em>
The Lord grant it may be a comfort and blessing
to my family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>"<em>March, 1735.</em> Had a safe and comfortable
journey to York.</p>

<p>"<em>April 24.</em> Shay overturned, with my wife
and I in it, yet neither of us much hurt. Blessed
be our gracious Preserver! Part of the shay, as
it lay upon one side, went over my wife, and yet
she was scarcely anything hurt. How wonderful
the preservation!</p>

<p>"<em>May 5.</em> Went to the Beach with three of
the children. The Beast being frighted, when
we were all out of the shay, overturned and broke
it. I desire (I hope I desire it) that the Lord
would teach me suitably to repent this Providence,
to make suitable remarks on it, and to be suitably
affected with it. Have I done well to get
me a shay? Have I not been proud or too fond
of this convenience? Do I exercise the faith in
the divine care and protection which I ought to
do? Should I not be more in my study, and less
fond of diversion? Do I not withhold more than
is meet from pious and charitable uses?</p>

<p>"<em>May 15.</em> Shay brought home; mending cost
30 shillings. Favored in this beyond expectation.</p>

<p>"<em>May 16.</em> My wife and I rode to Rumney
Marsh. The Beast frighted several times."</p></div>

<p>At last this divine comedy ends with the
pathetic conclusive line,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>"<em>June 4.</em> Disposed of my shay to the Rev.

<p>I will not pause to dwell on the laughable
episodes and queer characteristic features
of the Transcendental Period, though
such it had in abundance. They often
served to correct the soberer absurdity with
which our whole country was slipping unconsciously
down the easy incline of national
ruin and dishonor,&mdash;from which only a
bloody civil war could at last save us. Thoreau
saw this clearly, and his political utterances,
paradoxical as they seemed in the
two decades from 1840 to 1860, now read
like the words of a prophet. But there are
some points in the American Renaissance
which may here be touched on, so much
light do they throw on the times. It was
a period of strange faiths and singular apocalypses&mdash;that
of Charles Fourier being one.
In February, 1843, Mr. Emerson, writing
to Henry Thoreau from New York, where
he was then lecturing, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Mr. Brisbane has just given me a faithful
hour and a half of what he calls his principles,
and he shames truer men by his fidelity and zeal;
and already begins to hear the reverberations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
his single voice from most of the States of the
Union. He thinks himself sure of W. H. Channing
here, as a good Fourierist. I laugh incredulous
whilst he recites (for it seems always as if
he was repeating paragraphs out of his master's
book) descriptions of the self-augmenting potency
of the solar system, which is destined to contain
one hundred and thirty-two bodies, I believe,&mdash;and
his urgent inculcation of our <em>stellar duties</em>.
But it has its kernel of sound truth, and its insanity
is so wide of the New York insanities that
it is virtue and honor."</p></div>

<p>This was written a few months before
Thoreau himself went to New York, and it
was while there that he received from his
friends in Concord and in Harvard, the
wondrous account of Mr. Alcott's Paradise
Regained at Fruitlands; where in due time
Thoreau made his visit and inspected that
Garden of Eden on the Coldspring Brook.</p>

<p>If Mr. Brisbane had his "stellar duties"
and inculcated them in others, the Brook
Farmers of 1842-43 had their planetary mission
also; namely, to cultivate the face of
the planet they inhabited, and to do it with
their own hands, as Adam and Noah did.
Of the Brook Farm enterprise much has
been written, and much more will be; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
concerning the more individual dream of
Thoreau's friends at "Fruitlands," less is
known; and I may quote a few pages concerning
it from Thoreau's correspondence.
While Thoreau was at Staten Island in
1843, Mr. Emerson wrote to him often, giving
the news of Concord as a Transcendental
capital. In May of that year we
have this intelligence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Ellery Channing is well settled in his house,
and works very steadily thus far, and our intercourse
is very agreeable to me. Young Ball (B. W.)
has been to see me, and is a prodigious
reader and a youth of great promise,&mdash;born, too,
in the good town. Mr. Hawthorne is well, and
Mr. Alcott and Mr. Lane are revolving a purchase
in Harvard of ninety acres."</p></div>

<p>This was "Fruitlands," described in the
"Dial" for 1843, and which Charles Lane
himself describes in a letter soon to be cited.
In June, 1843, Mr. Emerson again sends
tidings from Concord, where the Fitchburg
railroad was then building:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The town is full of Irish, and the woods of
engineers, with theodolite and red flag, singing
out their feet and inches to each other from station
to station. Near Mr. Alcott's (the Hosmer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
cottage) the road is already begun. From Mr.
A. and Mr. Lane at Harvard we have yet heard
nothing. They went away in good spirits, having
sent 'Wood Abram' and Larned, and William
Lane before them with horse and plow, a
few days in advance, to begin the spring work.
Mr. Lane paid me a long visit, in which he was
more than I had ever known him gentle and
open; and it was impossible not to sympathize
with and honor projects that so often seem without
feet or hands. They have near a hundred
acres of land which they do not want, and no
house, which they want first of all. But they
account this an advantage, as it gives them the
occasion they so much desire,&mdash;of building after
their own idea. In the event of their attracting
to their company a carpenter or two, which is not
impossible, it would be a great pleasure to see
their building,&mdash;which could hardly fail to be
new and beautiful. They have fifteen acres of
woodland, with good timber."</p></div>

<p>Then, passing in a moment from "Fruitlands"
to Concord woods, Thoreau's friend
writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Ellery Channing is excellent company, and
we walk in all directions. He remembers you
with great faith and hope, thinks you ought not
to see Concord again these ten years; that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
ought to grind up fifty Concords in your mill;
and much other opinion and counsel he holds in
store on this topic. Hawthorne walked with me
yesterday afternoon, and not until after our return
did I read his 'Celestial Railroad,' which has
a serene strength we cannot afford not to praise,
in this low life. I have letters from Miss Fuller
at Niagara. She found it sadly cold and rainy at
the Falls."</p></div>

<p>Not so with Mr. Alcott and Mr. Lane in
the first flush of their hopes at Fruitlands.
On the 9th of June,&mdash;the date of the letter
just quoted being June 7,&mdash;Mr. Lane
writes to Thoreau:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;The receipt of two acceptable
numbers of the 'Pathfinder' reminds me
that I am not altogether forgotten by one who, if
not in the busy world, is at least much nearer to
it externally than I am. Busy indeed we all
are, since our removal here; but so recluse is our
position, that with the world at large we have
scarcely any connection. You may possibly have
heard that, after all our efforts during the spring
had failed to place us in connection with the
earth, and Mr. Alcott's journey to Oriskany and
Vermont had turned out a blank,&mdash;one afternoon
in the latter part of May, Providence sent
to us the legal owner of a slice of the planet in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
this township (Harvard), with whom we have
been enabled to conclude for the concession of
his rights. It is very remotely placed, nearly three
miles beyond the village, without a road, surrounded
by a beautiful green landscape of fields
and woods, with the distance filled up by some
of the loftiest mountains in the State. The views
are, indeed, most poetic and inspiring. You have
no doubt seen the neighborhood; but from these
very fields, where you may at once be at home and
out, there is enough to love and revel in for sympathetic
souls like yours. On the estate are
about fourteen acres of wood, part of it extremely
pleasant as a retreat, a very sylvan realization,
which only wants a Thoreau's mind to elevate it
to classic beauty.</p>

<p>"I have some imagination that you are not so
happy and so well housed in your present position
as you would be here amongst us; although
at present there is much hard manual labor,&mdash;so
much that, as you perceive, my usual handwriting
is very greatly suspended. We have
only two associates in addition to our own families;
our house accommodations are poor and
scanty; but the greatest want is of good female
aid. Far too much labor devolves on Mrs. Alcott.
If you should light on any such assistance,
it would be charitable to give it a direction this
way. We may, perhaps, be rather particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
about the quality; but the conditions will pretty
well determine the acceptability of the parties
without a direct adjudication on our part. For
though to me our mode of life is luxurious in the
highest degree, yet generally it seems to be
thought that the setting aside of all impure diet,
dirty habits, idle thoughts, and selfish feelings,
is a course of self-denial, scarcely to be encountered
or even thought of in such an alluring
world as this in which we dwell.</p>

<p>"Besides the busy occupations of each succeeding
day, we form, in this ample theatre of
hope, many forthcoming scenes. The nearer little
copse is designed as the site of the cottages.
Fountains can be made to descend from their granite
sources on the hill-slope to every apartment if
required. Gardens are to displace the warm grazing
glades on the south, and numerous human
beings, instead of cattle, shall here enjoy existence.
The farther wood offers to the naturalist
and the poet an exhaustless haunt; and a short
cleaning of the brook would connect our boat
with the Nashua. Such are the designs which
Mr. Alcott and I have just sketched, as, resting
from planting, we walked round this reserve.</p>

<p>"In your intercourse with the dwellers in the
great city, have you alighted on Mr. Edward Palmer,
who studies with Dr. Beach, the Herbalist?
He will, I think, from his previous nature-love,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
and his affirmations to Mr. Alcott, be animated
on learning of this actual wooing and winning of
Nature's regards. We should be most happy to
see him with us. Having become so far actual,
from the real, we might fairly enter into the
typical, if he could help us in any way to types
of the true metal. We have not passed away
from home, to see or hear of the world's doings,
but the report has reached us of Mr. W. H.
Channing's fellowship with the Phalansterians,
and of his eloquent speeches in their behalf.
Their progress will be much aided by his accession.
To both these worthy men be pleased to
suggest our humanest sentiments. While they
stand amongst men, it is well to find them acting
out the truest possible at the moment.</p>

<p>"Just before we heard of this place, Mr. Alcott
had projected a settlement at the Cliffs on
the Concord River, cutting down wood and building
a cottage; but so many more facilities were
presented here that we quitted the old classic
town for one which is to be not less renowned.
As far as I could judge, our absence promised
little pleasure to our old Concord friends; but at
signs of progress I presume they rejoiced with,
dear friend,</p>

<p class="salusig">
"Yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="author">"<span class="smcap">Charles Lane</span>."<br />
</p></div>

<p>Another Palmer than the Edward here
mentioned became an inmate of "Fruitlands,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
and, in course of time its owner;
the abandoned paradise, which was held by
Mr. Lane and Mr. Alcott for less than a
year, is now the property of his son. Mr.
Lane, after a time, returned to England and
died there; Mr. Alcott to Concord, where,
in 1845, he aided Thoreau in building his
hut by Walden. Mr. Channing (the nephew
and biographer of Dr. Channing) continued
his connection with the "Phalansterians"
in New Jersey until 1849 or later, for
in that year Fredrika Bremer found him
dwelling and preaching among them, at the
"North American Phalanstery," to which
he had been invited from his Unitarian parish
in Cincinnati, about the time that Brook
Farm was made a community, and before
Mr. Alcott's dream had taken earthly shape
at "Fruitlands." The account given by
Miss Bremer of the terms upon which Mr.
Channing was thus invited to New Jersey,
show what was the spirit of Transcendentalism
then, on its social side. They said to
him,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Come to us,&mdash;be our friend and spiritual
shepherd, but in perfect freedom. Follow your
own inspiration,&mdash;preach, talk to us, how and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
when it appears best to you. We undertake to
provide for your pecuniary wants; live free from
anxiety, how, and where you will; but teach us
how we should live and work; our homes and
our hearts are open to you."</p></div>

<p>It was upon such terms as this, honorable
alike to those who gave and those who received,
that much of the intellectual and
spiritual work of the Transcendental revival
was done. There was another and an unsocial
side to the movement also, which Mr.
Emerson early described in these words,
that apply to Thoreau and to Alcott at one
period:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is a sign of our times, conspicuous to the
coarsest observer, that many intelligent and religious
persons withdraw themselves from the common
labors and competitions of the market and
the caucus, and betake themselves to a solitary
and critical way of living, from which no solid
fruit has yet appeared to justify their separation.
They hold themselves aloof; they feel the disproportion
between themselves and the work
offered them, and they prefer to ramble in the
country and perish of ennui, to the degradation
of such charities and such ambitions as the city
can propose to them. They are striking work
and crying out for somewhat worthy to do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
They are lonely; the spirit of their writing and
conversation is lonely; they repel influences;
they shun general society; they incline to shut
themselves in their chamber in the house; to live
in the country rather than in the town; and to
find their tasks and amusements in solitude. They
are not good citizens, not good members of society;
unwillingly they bear their part of the
public and private burdens; they do not willingly
share in the public charities, in the public religious
rites, in the enterprise of education, of
missions, foreign or domestic, in the abolition of
the slave trade, or in the temperance society.
They do not even like to vote. The philanthropists
inquire whether Transcendentalism does not
mean sloth; they had as lief hear that their
friend is dead, as that he is a Transcendentalist;
for then is he paralyzed, and can do nothing for
humanity."</p></div>

<p>It was this phase of Transcendentalism
that gave most anxiety to Thoreau's good
old pastor, Dr. Ripley, who early foresaw
what immediate fruit might be expected
from this fair tree of mysticism,&mdash;this
"burning bush" which had started up, all
at once, in the very garden of his parsonage.
I know few epistles more pathetic in
their humility and concern for the future,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
than one which Dr. Ripley addressed to Dr.
Channing in February, 1839, after hearing
and meditating on the utterances of Alcott,
Emerson, Thoreau, George Ripley, and the
other "apostles of the newness," who disturbed
with their oracles the quiet air of
his parish. He wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Denied, as I am, the privilege of going from
home, of visiting and conversing with enlightened
friends, and of reading even; broken down with
the infirmities of age, and subject to fits that deprive
me of reason and the use of my limbs, I
feel it a duty to be patient and submissive to the
will of God, who is too wise to err, and too good
to injure. Some reason is left,&mdash;my mental
powers, though weak, are yet awake, and I long
to be doing something for good. The contrast
between paper and ink is so strong, that I can
write better than do anything else. In this way
I take the liberty to express to you a few
thoughts, which you will receive as well-meant
and sincere....</p>

<p>"We may certainly assume that whatever is
unreasonable, self-contradictory, and destitute of
common sense, is erroneous. Should we not be
likely to find the truth, in all moral subjects,
were we to make more use of plain reason and
common sense? I know that our modern speculators,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Transcendentalists, or, as they prefer to
be called, Realists, presume to follow Reason in
her purest dictates, her sublime and unfrequented
regions. They presume, by her power, not only
to discover what is truth, but to judge of revealed
truth. But is not their whole process marred by
leaving out common sense, by which mankind are
generally governed? That superiority which
places a man above the power of doing good to
his fellow-men seems to me not very desirable.
I honor most the man who transcends others in
capacity and disposition to do good, and whose
daily practice corresponds with his profession.
Here I speak of professed Christians. I would
not treat with disrespect and severe censure men
who advance sentiments which I may neither approve
nor understand, provided their authors be
men of learning, piety, and holy lives. The speculations
and novel opinions of <em>such</em> men rarely
prove injurious. Nevertheless, I would that
their mental endowments might find a better
method of doing good,&mdash;a more simple and intelligible
manner of informing and reforming
their fellow-men....</p>

<p>"The hope of the gospel is my hope, my consolation,
support and rejoicing. Such is my state
of health that death is constantly before me; no
minute would it be unexpected. I am waiting
in faith and hope, but humble and penitent for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
my imperfections and faults. The prayer of the
publican, 'God be merciful to me a sinner!' is
never forgotten. I have hoped to see and converse
with you, but now despair. If you shall
think I use too much freedom with you, charge
it to the respect and esteem which are cherished
for your character by your affectionate friend
and brother,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, <em>February 26, 1839</em>."<br />
</p></div>

<p>At this time Dr. Ripley was almost
eighty-eight, and he lived two years longer,
to mourn yet more pathetically over the
change of times and manners. "It was
fit," said Emerson, "that in the fall of
laws, this loyal man should die." But the
young men who succeeded him were no
less loyal to the unwritten laws, and from
their philosophy, which to the old theologian
seemed so misty and unreal, there flowered
forth, in due season, the most active
and world-wide philanthropies. Twenty
years after this pastoral epistle, there came
to Concord another Christian of the antique
type, more Puritan and Hebraic than Dr.
Ripley himself, yet a Transcendentalist,
too,&mdash;and <span class="smcap">John Brown</span> found no lack
of practical good-will in Thoreau, Alcott,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Emerson, and the other Transcendentalists.
The years had "come full circle," the Sibyl
had burnt her last prophetic book, and the
new æon was about to open with the downfall
of slavery.</p>

EARLY ESSAYS IN AUTHORSHIP.</h2>


<p>It has been a common delusion, not yet
quite faded away, that the chief Transcendentalists
were but echoes of each other,&mdash;that
Emerson imitated Carlyle, Thoreau
and Alcott imitated Emerson, and so on to
the end of the chapter. No doubt that the
atmosphere of each of these men affected
the others, nor that they shared a common
impulse communicated by what Matthew
Arnold likes to call the <em>Zeitgeist</em>,&mdash;the
ever-felt spirit of the time. In the most
admirable of the group, who is called by
preëminence "the Sage of Concord,"&mdash;the
poet Emerson,&mdash;there has been an out-breathing
inspiration as profound as that of
the <em>Zeitgeist</em> himself; so that even Hawthorne,
the least susceptible of men, found
himself affected as he says, "after living
for three years within the subtle influence
of an intellect like Emerson's." But, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
fact, Thoreau brought to his intellectual
tasks an originality as marked as Emerson's,
if not so brilliant and star-like&mdash;a
patience far greater than his, and a proud
independence that makes him the most solitary
of modern thinkers. I have been
struck by these qualities in reading his yet
unknown first essays in authorship, the
juvenile papers he wrote while in college,
from the age of seventeen to that of twenty,
before Emerson had published anything except
his first little volume, "Nature," and
while Thoreau, like other young men, was
reading Johnson and Goldsmith, Addison
and the earlier English classics, from Milton
backward to Chaucer. Let me therefore
quote from these papers, carefully
preserved by him, with their dates, and
sometimes with the marks of the rhetorical
professor on their margins. Along with
these may be cited some of his earlier verses,
in which a sentiment more purely human
and almost amatory appears, than in the
later and colder, if higher flights of his
song.</p>

<p>The earliest writings of Thoreau, placed
in my hands by his literary executor, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Harrison Blake of Worcester, are the first
of his Cambridge essays, technically called
"themes" and "forensics." These began
several years before his daily journals were
kept, namely, in 1834; and it is curious
that one of them, dated January 17, 1835,
but written in 1834, recommends "keeping
a private journal or record of our thoughts,
feelings, studies, and daily experience."
This is precisely what Thoreau did from
1837 till his death; and it may be interesting
to see what reasons the boy of seventeen
advanced for the practice. He says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"As those pieces which the painter sketches
for his own amusement, in his leisure hours, are
often superior to his most elaborate productions,
so it is that ideas often suggest themselves to us
spontaneously, as it were, far surpassing in beauty
those which arise in the mind upon applying ourselves
to any particular subject. Hence, could a
machine be invented which would instantaneously
arrange upon paper each idea as it occurs to us,
without any exertion on our part, how extremely
useful would it be considered! The relation between
this and the practice of keeping a journal
is obvious.... If each one would employ a
certain portion of each day in looking back upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
the time which has passed, and in writing down
his thoughts and feelings, in reckoning up his
daily gains, that he may be able to detect whatever
false coins may have crept into his coffers,
and, as it were, in settling accounts with his
mind,&mdash;not only would his daily experience be
greatly increased, since his feelings and ideas
would thus be more clearly defined,&mdash;but he
would be ready to turn over a new leaf (having
carefully perused the preceding one) and would
not continue to glance carelessly over the same
page, without being able to distinguish it from a
new one."</p></div>

<p>This is ingenious, quaint, and mercantile,
bespeaking the hereditary bent of his family
to trade and orderly accounts; but what
follows in the same essay is more to the
purpose, as striking the key-note of Thoreau's
whole after-life. He adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Most of us are apt to neglect the study of
our own characters, thoughts, and feelings, and,
for the purpose of forming our own minds, look
to others, <em>who should merely be considered as different
editions of the same great work</em>. To be
sure, it would be well for us to examine the various
copies, that we might detect any errors;
yet it would be foolish for one <em>to borrow a work
which he possessed himself, but had not perused</em>."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>The earliest record of the day's observations
which I find is dated a few months
later than this (April 20, 1835), when
Henry Thoreau was not quite eighteen, and
relates to the beauties of nature. The first
passage describes a Sunday prospect from
the garret window of his father's house,
(afterwards the residence of Mr. William
Munroe, the benefactor of the Concord Library),
on the main street of the village.
He writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"'Twas always my delight to monopolize the
little Gothic window which overlooked the kitchen-garden,
particularly of a Sabbath afternoon;
when all around was quiet, and Nature herself
was taking her afternoon nap,&mdash;when the last
peal of the bell in the neighboring steeple,</p>

<p class="center">
'Swinging slow with sullen roar,'<br />
</p>

<p>had 'left the vale to <em>solitude</em> and <em>me</em>,' and the
very air scarcely dared breathe, lest it should disturb
the universal calm. Then did I use, with
eyes upturned, to gaze upon the clouds, and, allowing
my imagination to wander, search for flaws
in their rich drapery, that I might get a peep
at that world beyond, which they seem intended
to veil from our view. Now is my attention engaged
by a truant hawk, as, like a messenger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
from those ethereal regions, he issues from the
bosom of a cloud, and, at first a mere speck in
the distance, comes circling onward, exploring
every seeming creek, and rounding every jutting
precipice. And now, his mission ended, what
can be more majestic than his stately flight, as
he wheels around some towering pine, enveloped
in a cloud of smaller birds that have united to
expel him from their premises."</p></div>

<p>The second passage, under the same date,
seems to describe earlier and repeated visits,
made by his elder brother John and himself,
to a hill which was always a favorite
resort of Thoreau's, Fairhaven Cliffs, overlooking
the river-bay, known as "Fairhaven,"
a mile or two up the river from Concord
village toward Sudbury:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In the freshness of the dawn my brother and
I were ever ready to enjoy a stroll to a certain
cliff, distant a mile or more, where we were wont
to climb to the highest peak, and seating ourselves
on some rocky platform, catch the first ray
of the morning sun, as it gleamed upon the
smooth, still river, wandering in sullen silence
far below. The approach to the precipice is by
no means calculated to prepare one for the glorious
<em>dénouement</em> at hand. After following for
some time a delightful path that winds through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the woods, occasionally crossing a rippling brook,
and not forgetting to visit a sylvan dell, whose
solitude is made audible by the unwearied tinkling
of a crystal spring,&mdash;you suddenly emerge
from the trees upon a flat and mossy rock, which
forms the summit of a beetling crag. The feelings
which come over one on first beholding this
freak of nature are indescribable. The giddy
height, the iron-bound rock, the boundless horizon
open around, and the beautiful river at your feet,
with its green and sloping banks, fringed with
trees and shrubs of every description, are calculated
to excite in the beholder emotions of no
common occurrence,&mdash;to inspire him with noble
and sublime emotions. The eye wanders over
the broad and seemingly compact surface of the
slumbering forest on the opposite side of the
stream, and catches an occasional glimpse of a
little farm-house, 'resting in a green hollow, and
lapped in the bosom of plenty;' while a gentle
swell of the river, a rustic, and fortunately rather
old-looking bridge on the right, with the cloudlike
Wachusett in the distance, give a finish and
beauty to the landscape, that is rarely to be met
with even in our own fair land. This interesting
spot, if we may believe tradition, was the favorite
haunt of the red man, before the axe of
his pale-faced visitor had laid low its loftier honors,
or his 'strong water' had wasted the energies
of the race."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>Here we have a touch of fine writing,
natural in a boy who had read Irving and
Goldsmith, and exaggerating a little the
dimensions of the rocks and rills of which
he wrote. But how smooth the flow of description,
how well-placed the words, how
sure and keen the eye of the young observer!
To this mount of vision did Thoreau
and his friends constantly resort in after
years, and it was on the plateau beneath
that Mr. Alcott, in 1843, was about to cut
down the woods and build his Paradise,
when a less inviting fate, as he thought,
beckoned his English friend Lane and himself
to "Fruitlands," in the distant town
of Harvard. At some time after this, perhaps
while Thoreau was encamped at Walden
with his books and his flute, Mr. Emerson
sent him the following note, which
gives us now a glimpse into that Arcadia:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Will you not come up to the Cliff this <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>,
at any hour convenient to you, where our ladies
will be greatly gratified to see you? and the
more, they say, if you will bring your flute for
the echo's sake, though now the wind blows.</p>

<p class="author">
"R. W. E.</p>

<p>"Monday, 1 o'clock <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>"<br />
</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>It does not appear that Thoreau wrote
verses at this time, though he was a great
reader of the best poetry,&mdash;of Milton very
early, and with constant admiration and
quotation. Thus, in a college essay of 1835,
on "Simplicity of Style," he has this passage
concerning the Bible and Milton:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The most sublime and noblest precepts may
be conveyed in a plain and simple strain. The
Scriptures afford abundant proof of this. What
images can be more natural, what sentiments of
greater weight and at the same time more noble
and exalted than those with which they abound?
They possess no local or relative ornament which
may be lost in a translation; clothed in whatever
dress, they still retain their peculiar beauties.
Here is simplicity itself. Every one allows
this, every one admires it, yet how few attain
to it! The union of wisdom and simplicity is
plainly hinted at in the following lines of Milton:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">"Suspicion sleeps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Wisdom's gate, and to <em>Simplicity</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resigns her charge.'"<br /></span>
</div></div></div></div>

<p>Early in 1837 Thoreau wrote an elaborate
paper, though of no great length, on
Milton's "L'Allegro" and "Il Penseroso,"
with many quotations, in course of which
he said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"These poems place Milton in an entirely new
and extremely pleasing light to the reader, who
was previously familiar with him as the author
of 'Paradise Lost' alone. If before he venerated,
he may now admire and love him. The
immortal Milton seems for a space to have put
on mortality,&mdash;to have snatched a moment
from the weightier cares of Heaven and Hell, to
wander for a while among the sons of men....
I have dwelt upon the poet's beauties and not so
much as glanced at his blemishes. A pleasing
image, or a fine sentiment loses none of its
charms, though Burton, or Beaumont and Fletcher,
or Marlowe, or Sir Walter Raleigh, may have
written something very similar,&mdash;or even in another
connection, may have used the identical
word, whose aptness we so much admire. That
always appeared to me a contemptible kind of
criticism which, deliberately and in cold blood,
can dissect the sublimest passage, and take pleasure
in the detection of slight verbal incongruities;
when applied to Milton, it is little better
than sacrilege."</p></div>

<p>The moral view taken by the young collegian
in these essays is quite as interesting
as the literary opinions, or the ease of his
style. In September, 1835, discussing punishments,
he says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Certainty is more effectual than severity of
punishment. No man will deliberately cut his
own fingers. Some have asked, 'Cannot reward
be substituted for punishment? Is hope a less
powerful incentive to action than fear? When
a political pharmacop&#339;ia has the command of
both ingredients, wherefore employ the bitter instead
of the sweet?' This reasoning is absurd.
Does a man deserve to be rewarded for refraining
from murder? Is the greatest virtue merely
negative? or does it rather consist in the performance
of a thousand every-day duties, hidden
from the eye of the world?"</p></div>

<p>In an essay on the effect of story-telling,
written in 1836, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The story of the world never ceases to interest.
The child enchanted by the melodies of
Mother Goose, the scholar pondering 'the tale
of Troy divine,' and the historian breathing the
atmosphere of past ages,&mdash;all manifest the same
passion, are alike the creatures of curiosity. The
same passion for the novel (somewhat modified,
to be sure), that is manifested in our early days,
leads us, in after-life, when the sprightliness and
credulity of youth have given way to the reserve
and skepticism of manhood, to the more serious,
though scarcely less wonderful annals of the
world. The love of stories and of story-telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
cherishes a purity of heart, a frankness and candor
of disposition, a respect for what is generous
and elevated, a contempt for what is mean and
dishonorable, and tends to multiply merry companions
and never-failing friends."</p></div>

<p>In March, 1837, in an essay on the source
of our feeling of the sublime, Thoreau
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The emotion excited by the sublime is the
most unearthly and god-like we mortals experience.
It depends for the peculiar strength with
which it takes hold on and occupies the mind,
upon a principle which lies at the foundation of
that worship which we pay to the Creator himself.
And is fear the foundation of that worship?
Is fear the ruling principle of our religion?
Is it not rather the mother of superstition?
Yes, that principle which prompts us to pay an
involuntary homage to the infinite, the incomprehensible,
the sublime, forms the very basis of our
religion. It is a principle implanted in us by
our Maker, a part of our very selves; we cannot
eradicate it, we cannot resist it; fear may be
overcome, death may be despised; but the infinite,
the sublime seize upon the soul and disarm it.
We may overlook them, or rather fall short of
them; we may pass them by, but, so sure as we
meet them face to face, we yield."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>Speaking of national characteristics, he
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is not a little curious to observe how man,
the boasted lord of creation, is the slave of a
name, a mere sound. How much mischief have
those magical words, North, South, East, and
West caused! Could we rest satisfied with one
mighty, all-embracing West, leaving the other
three cardinal points to the Old World, methinks
we should not have cause for so much apprehension
about the preservation of the Union."</p></div>

<p>(This was written in February, 1837.)
Before he had reached the age of nineteen
he thus declared his independence of foreign
opinion, while asserting its general
sway over American literature, in 1836:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We are, as it were, but colonies. True, we
have declared our independence, and gained our
liberty, but we have dissolved only the political
bands which connected us with Great Britain;
though we have rejected her tea, she still supplies
us with food for the mind. The aspirant
to fame must breathe the atmosphere of foreign
parts, and learn to talk about things which the
homebred student never dreamed of, if he would
have his talents appreciated or his opinion regarded
by his countrymen. Ours are authors of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
the day, they bid fair to outlive their works;
they are too fashionable to write for posterity.
True, there are some amongst us, who can contemplate
the babbling brook, without, in imagination,
polluting its waters with a mill-wheel;
but even they are prone to sing of skylarks and
nightingales perched on hedges, to the neglect of
the homely robin-redbreast and the straggling
rail-fences of their own native land."</p></div>

<p>So early did he take this position, from
which he never varied.</p>

<p>In May, 1837, we find another note of
his opening life, in an essay on Paley's
"Common Reasons." He says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Man does not wantonly rend the meanest tie
that binds him to his fellows; he would not stand
aloof, even in his prejudices, did not the stern
demands of truth require it. He is ready enough
to float with the tide, and when he does stem the
current of popular opinion, sincerity, at least,
must nerve his arm. He has not only the burden
of proof, but that of reproof to support. We
may call him a fanatic, an enthusiast; but these
are titles of honor; they signify the devotion
and entire surrendering of himself to his cause.
So far as my experience goes, man <em>never</em> seriously
maintained an objectionable principle, doctrine,
or theory; error <em>never</em> had a sincere defender;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
her disciples were <em>never</em> enthusiasts.
This is strong language, I confess, but I do not
rashly make use of it. We are told that 'to err
is human,' but I would rather call it inhuman, if
I may use the word in this sense. I speak not
of those errors that have to do with facts and occurrences,
but rather, errors of judgment."</p></div>

<p>Here we have that bold generalization
and that calm love of paradox which mark
his later style. The lofty imagination was
always his, too, as where this youth of nineteen
says in the same essay:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Mystery is yet afar off,&mdash;it is but a cloud in
the distance, whose shadow, as it flits across the
landscape, gives a pleasing variety to the scene.
But as the perfect day approaches, its morning
light discovers the dark and straggling clouds,
which at first skirted the horizon, assembling as
at a signal, and as they expand and multiply,
rolling slowly onward to the zenith, till, at last,
the whole heavens, if we except a faint glimmering
in the East, are overshadowed."</p></div>

<p>What a confident and flowing movement
of thought is here! like the prose of Milton
or Jeremy Taylor, but with a more restrained
energy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>"Duty," writes the young moralist in another
essay of 1837, "is one and invariable; it requires
no impossibilities, nor can it ever be disregarded
with impunity; so far as it exists, it is
binding; and, if all duties are binding, so as on
no account to be neglected, how can one bind
stronger than another?" "None but the highest
minds can attain to moral excellence. With by
far the greater part of mankind religion is a
habit; or rather habit is religion. However paradoxical
it may seem, it appears to me that to
reject <em>religion</em> is the first step towards moral excellence;
at least no man ever attained to the
highest degree of the latter by any other road.
Could infidels live double the number of years
allotted to other mortals, they would become
patterns of excellence. So, too, of all true poets,&mdash;they
would neglect the beautiful for the true."</p></div>

<p>I suspect that Thoreau's first poems
date from the year 1836-37, since the
"big red journal," in which they were
copied, was begun in October, 1837. The
verses entitled, "To the Maiden in the
East," were by no means among the first,
which date from 1836 or earlier; but near
these in time was that poem called "Sympathy,"
which was the first of his writings to appear
in Mr. Emerson's "Dial." These last
were addressed, we are told, to Ellen Sewall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
with whom, the legend says, both Henry
and John Thoreau were in love. Few of
these poems show any imitation of Mr.
Emerson, whose own verses at that time
were mostly unpublished, though he sometimes
read them in private to his friends.
But like most of Thoreau's verses, these indicate
a close familiarity with the Elizabethan
literature, and what directly followed
it, in the time of the Stuarts. The measure
of "Sympathy" was that of Davenant's
"Gondibert," which Thoreau, almost alone
of his contemporaries, had read; the thought
was above Davenant, and ranged with Raleigh
and Spenser. These verses will not
soon be forgotten:&mdash;</p>

<p>A frivolous question has sometimes been
raised whether the young Thoreau knew
what love was, like the Sicilian shepherd,
who found him a native of the rocks, a lion's
whelp. With his poet-nature, he early
gathered this experience, and passed on;
praising afterwards the lion's nature in the
universal god:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Red Journal of five hundred and
ninety-six long pages, in which the early
verses occur, was the first collection of Thoreau's
systematic diarizing. It ran on from
October, 1837, to June, 1840, and was succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
by another journal of three hundred
and ninety-six pages, which was finished
early in 1841. He wrote his first lecture
(on Society) in March, 1838, and read it
before the Concord Lyceum in the Freemasons'
Hall, April 11, 1838. In the December
following he wrote a memorable essay
on "Sound and Silence," and in February,
1840, wrote his "first printed paper
of consequence," as he says, on "Aulus Persius
Flaccus." The best of the early verses
seem to have been written in 1836-41. His
contributions to the "Dial," which he helped
edit, were taken from his journals, and ran
through nearly every number from July,
1840, to April, 1844, when that magazine
ceased.</p>

<p>For these papers he received nothing but
the thanks of Emerson and the praise of a
few readers. Miss Elizabeth Peabody, in
February, 1843, wrote to Thoreau, that
"the regular income of the 'Dial' does not
pay the cost of its printing and paper; yet
there are readers enough to support it, if
they would only subscribe; and they will
subscribe, if they are convinced that only
by doing so can they secure its continuance."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
They did not subscribe, and in the
spring of 1844 it came to an end.</p>

<p>In 1842 Thoreau took a walk to Wachusett,
his nearest mountain, and the journal
of this excursion was printed in the "Boston
Miscellany" of 1843. In it occurred the
verses, written at least as early as 1841, in
which he addresses the mountains of his
horizon, Monadnoc, Wachusett, and the Peterborough
Hills of New Hampshire. These
verses were for some time in the hands of
<a id="Margaret_Fuller"></a>Margaret Fuller, for publication in the
"Dial," if she saw fit, but she returned
them with the following characteristic letter,&mdash;the
first addressed by her to Thoreau:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="datesig">
"[<span class="smcap">Concord</span>] <em>18th October, 1841</em>.
</p>

<p>"I do not find the poem on the mountains improved
by mere compression, though it might be
by fusion and glow. Its merits to me are, a
noble recognition of Nature, two or three manly
thoughts, and, in one place, a plaintive music.
The image of the ships does not please me originally.
It illustrates the greater by the less, and
affects me as when Byron compares the light on
Jura to that of the dark eye of woman. I cannot
define my position here, and a large class of
readers would differ from me. As the poet goes
on to&mdash;</p>

<p>he seems to chase an image, already rather forced,
into conceits.</p>

<p>"Yet, now that I have some knowledge of the
man, it seems there is no objection I could make
to his lines (with the exception of such offenses
against taste as the lines about the humors of the
eye, as to which we are already agreed), which I
would not make to himself. He is healthful,
rare, of open eye, ready hand, and noble scope.
He sets no limits to his life, nor to the invasions
of nature; he is not willfully pragmatical, cautious,
ascetic, or fantastical. But he is as yet a
somewhat bare hill, which the warm gales of
Spring have not visited. Thought lies too detached,
truth is seen too much in detail; we can
number and mark the substances imbedded in
the rock. Thus his verses are startling as much
as stern; the thought does not excuse its conscious
existence by letting us see its relation with
life; there is a want of fluent music. Yet what
could a companion do at present, unless to tame
the guardian of the Alps too early? Leave him
at peace amid his native snows. He is friendly;
he will find the generous office that shall educate
him. It is not a soil for the citron and the rose,
but for the whortleberry, the pine, or the heather.</p>

<p>"The unfolding of affections, a wider and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
deeper human experience, the harmonizing influences
of other natures, will mould the man and
melt his verse. He will seek thought less and
find knowledge the more. I can have no advice
or criticism for a person so sincere; but, if I
give my impression of him, I will say, 'He says
too constantly of Nature, she is mine.' She is
not yours till you have been more hers. Seek
the lotus, and take a draught of rapture. Say
not so confidently, all places, all occasions are
alike. This will never come true till you have
found it false.</p>

<p>"I do not know that I have more to say now;
perhaps these words will say nothing to you. If
intercourse should continue, perhaps a bridge
may be made between two minds so widely
apart; for I apprehended you in spirit, and you
did not seem to mistake me so widely as most of
your kind do. If you should find yourself inclined
to write to me, as you thought you might,
I dare say, many thoughts would be suggested to
me; many have already, by seeing you from day
to day. Will you finish the poem in your own
way, and send it for the 'Dial'? Leave out</p>

<p>The image is too low; Mr. Emerson thought so
too.</p>

secrecy; it keeps its own secrets; it cannot be
made false. Thus you will not be sorry that I
have seen the paper. Will you not send me some
other records of the <em>good week</em>?"</p></div>

<p>"Faithful are the wounds of a friend."
This searching criticism would not offend
Thoreau; nor yet the plainness with which
the same tongue told the faults of a prose
paper&mdash;perhaps "The Service,"&mdash;which
Margaret rejected in this note:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am to blame for so long detaining your
manuscript. But my thoughts have been so engaged
that I have not found a suitable hour to reread
it as I wished, till last night. This second
reading only confirms my impression from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
first. The essay is rich in thoughts, and I should
be <em>pained</em> not to meet it again. But then, the
thoughts seem to me so out of their natural order,
that I cannot read it through without <em>pain</em>. I
never once feel myself in a stream of thought, but
seem to hear the grating of tools on the mosaic.
It is true, as Mr. Emerson says, that essays not to
be compared with this have found their way into
the 'Dial.' But then, these are more unassuming
in their tone, and have an air of quiet good-breeding,
which induces us to permit their presence.
Yours is so rugged that it ought to be
commanding."</p></div>

<p>These were the years of Thoreau's apprenticeship
in literature, and many were
the tasks and mortifications he must endure
before he became a master of the writer's
art.</p>

FRIENDS AND COMPANIONS.</h2>


<p>"Margaret Fuller," says William
Henry Channing, "was indeed The Friend;
this was her vocation." It was no less the
vocation of Thoreau, though in a more
lofty, unvarying, and serene manner.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Literally," says the friend who best knew
him, "his views of friendship were high and
noble. Those who loved him never had the least
reason to regret it. He made no useless professions,
never asked one of those questions that
destroy all relation; but he was on the spot at
the time, and had so much of human life in his
keeping to the last, that he could spare a breathing-place
for a friend. He meant friendship, and
meant nothing else, and stood by it without the
slightest abatement; not veering as a weathercock
with each shift of a friend's fortune, nor
like those who bury their early friendships, in
order to make room for fresh corpses."</p></div>

<p>It is, therefore, impossible to sketch him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
by himself. He could have said, with Ellery
Channing,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O band of Friends, ye breathe within this space,<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>His earliest companion was his brother
John, "a flowing generous spirit," as one
described him, for whom his younger
brother never ceased to grieve. Walking
among the Cohasset rocks and looking at
the scores of shipwrecked men from the
Irish brig St. John, in 1849, he said, "A
man can attend but one funeral in his life,
can behold but one corpse." With him it
was the funeral of John Thoreau in February,
1842. They had made the voyage of
the Concord and Merrimac together, in
1839; they had walked and labored together,
and invented Indian names for one
another from boyhood. John was "Sachem
Hopeful of Hopewell,"&mdash;a sunny soul, always
serene and loving. When publishing
his first book, in 1849, Henry dedicated it
to this brother, with the simple verse&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where'er thou sail'st who sailed with me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though now thou climbest loftier mounts,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Be thou my Muse, my Brother John."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>
<p>John Thoreau's death was singular and
painful; his brother could not speak of it
without physical suffering, so that when he
related it to his friend Ricketson at New
Bedford, he turned pale and was forced to
go to the door for air. This was the only
time Mr. Ricketson ever saw him show deep
emotion. His sister Sophia once said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Henry rarely spoke of dear John; it pained
him too much. He sent the following verses

that they apply to himself:"&mdash;</p>

<p>Before the death of his brother, Thoreau
had formed the friendship with Ellery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Channing, that was in some degree to replace
the daily intimacy he had enjoyed
with John Thoreau. This man of genius,
and of the moods that sometimes make
genius an unhappy boon, was a year younger
than Thoreau when he came, in 1843, to
dwell in Concord with his bride, a younger
sister of Margaret Fuller. They lived first
in a cottage near Mr. Emerson's, Thoreau
being at that time an inmate of Mr. Emerson's
household; afterwards, in 1843, Mr.
Channing removed to a hill-top some miles
away, then to New York in 1844-45, then
to Europe for a few months, and finally to
a house on the main street of the village,
opposite the last residence of the Thoreau
family, where Henry lived from 1850 till
his death in 1862. In the garden of Mr.
Channing's house, which lay on the river,
Thoreau kept his boat, under a group of
willows, and from that friendly harbor all
his later voyages were made. At times
they talked of occupying this house together.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have an old house and a garden patch,"
said Channing, "you have legs and arms, and we
both need each other's companionship. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
miserable cracks and crannies which have made
the wall of life look thin and fungus-like, will
be cemented by the sweet and solid mortar of
friendship."</p></div>

<p>They did in fact associate more closely
than if they had lived in the same house.</p>

<p>At the age of thirty-seven, when contemplating
a removal from the neighborhood
of his friend Thoreau, this humorous man
of letters thus described himself and his
tastes to another friend:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I am a poet, or of a poetical temper or mood,
with a very limited income both of brains and of
moneys. This world is rather a sour world. But
as I am, equally with you, an admirer of Cowper,
why should I not prove a sort of unnecessary addition
to your neighborhood possibly? I may
leave Concord, and my aim would be to get a
small place, in the vicinity of a large town, with
some land, and, if possible, near to some <em>one</em> person
with whom I might in some measure fraternize.
Come, my neighbor! thou hast now a new
occupation, the setting up of a poet and literary
man,&mdash;one who loves old books, old garrets, old
wines, old pipes, and (last not least) Cowper.
We might pass the winter in comparing <em>variorum</em>
editions of our favorite authors, and the summer in
walking and horticulture. This is a grand scheme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
of life. All it requires is the house of which I
spake. I think one in middle life feels averse
to change, and especially to local change. The
Lares and Penates love to establish themselves,
and desire no moving. But the fatal hour may
come, when, bidding one long, one last adieu to
those weather-beaten Penates, we sally forth with
Don Quixote, once more to strike our lances into
some new truth, or life, or man."</p></div>

<p>This hour did come, and the removal
was made for a few months or years, during
which the two friends met at odd intervals,
and in queer companionship. But the
"sweet and solid mortar of friendship" was
never broken, though the wall of life came
to look like a ruin. When, in Thoreau's
last illness, Channing, in deep grief, said
"that a change had come over the dream
of life, and that solitude began to peer out
curiously from the dells and wood-roads,"
Thoreau whispered, "with his foot on the
step of the other world," says Channing,
"It is better some things should end." Of
their earlier friendship, and of Channing's
poetic gift, so admirable, yet so little appreciated
by his contemporaries, this mention
occurs in a letter written by Thoreau
in March, 1856:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I was surprised to hear the other day that
Channing was in X. When he was here last
(in December, I think), he said, like himself, in
answer to my inquiry where he lived, 'that he
did not know the name of the place;' so it has
remained in a degree of obscurity to me. I am
rejoiced to hear that you are getting on so bravely
with him and his verses. He and I, as you know,
have been old cronies,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Fed the same flock, by fountain, shade, and rill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Together both, ere the high lawns appeared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the opening eyelids of the morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We drove afield, and both together heared,' etc.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>"'But O, the heavy change,' now he is gone.
The Channing you have seen and described is
the real Simon Pure. You have seen him.
Many a good ramble may you have together!
You will see in him still more of the same kind
to attract and to puzzle you. How to serve him
most effectually has long been a problem with his
friends. Perhaps it is left for you to solve it.
I suspect that the most that you or any one
can do for him is to appreciate his genius,&mdash;to
buy and read, and cause others to buy and
read his poems. That is the hand which he
has put forth to the world,&mdash;take hold of that.
Review them if you can,&mdash;perhaps take the risk
of publishing something more which he may
write. Your knowledge of Cowper will help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
you to know Channing. He will accept sympathy
and aid, but he will not bear questioning, unless
the aspects of the sky are particularly auspicious.
He will ever be 'reserved and enigmatic,'
and you must deal with him at arm's
length. I have no secrets to tell you concerning
him, and do not wish to call obvious excellences
and defects by far-fetched names. Nor need I
suggest how witty and poetic he is,&mdash;and what
an inexhaustible fund of good-fellowship you will
find in him."</p></div>

<p>In the record of his winter visitors at
Walden, Thoreau had earlier made mention
of Channing, who then lived on Ponkawtasset
Hill, two or three miles away from
the hermitage.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"He who came from farthest to my lodge,"
says Thoreau, "through deepest snows and most
dismal tempests, was a poet. A farmer, a hunter,
a soldier, a reporter, even a philosopher may
be daunted, but nothing can deter a poet, for he
is actuated by pure love. Who can predict his
comings and goings? His business calls him out
at all hours; even when doctors sleep. We
made that small house ring with boisterous mirth,
and resound with the murmur of much sober
talk,&mdash;making amends then to Walden vale for
the long silences. At suitable intervals there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
were regular salutes of laughter, which might
have been referred indifferently to the last uttered
or the forthcoming jest."</p></div>

<p>In his "Week," as Thoreau floats down
the Concord, past the Old Manse, he commemorates
first Hawthorne and then Channing,
saying of the latter,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"On Ponkawtasset, since, with such delay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down this still stream we took our meadowy way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A poet wise hath settled whose fine ray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doth faintly shine on Concord's twilight day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like those first stars, whose silver beams on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shining more brightly as the day goes by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most travelers cannot at first descry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But eyes that wont to range the evening sky."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>These were true and deserved compliments,
but they availed little (no more than
did the praises of Emerson in the "Dial,"
and of Hawthorne in his "Mosses") to
make Channing known to the general reader.
Some years after Thoreau's death,
when writing to another friend, this neglected
poet said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Is there no way of disabusing S. of the liking
he has for the verses I used to write? You
probably know he is my only patron, but that
is no reason he should be led astray. <em>There is no
other test</em> of the value of poetry, but its popularity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
My verses have never secured a single
reader but S. He really believes, I think, in
those so-called verses; but they are not good,&mdash;they
are wholly unknown and unread, and always
will be. Mediocre poetry is worse than nothing,&mdash;and
mine is not even mediocre. I have presented
S. with the last set of those little books
there is, to have them bound, if he will. He can
keep them as a literary <em>curio</em>, and in his old age
amuse himself with thinking, 'How could ever I
have liked these?'"</p></div>

<p>Yet this self-disparaging poet was he who
wrote,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If my bark sinks, 't is to another sea,"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>and who cried to his companions,&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">And see afar the flashing sea-gulls play<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the free waters, and the glad bright day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twine with his hand the spray,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">From out your dreariness,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">From your heart-weariness,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">I speak, for I am yours<br /></span>
<span class="i10">On these gray shores."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is he, also, who has best told, in prose
and verse, what Thoreau was in his character
and his literary art. In dedicating to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
his friend Henry, the poem called "Near
Home," published in 1858, Channing thus
addressed him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"Modest and mild and kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who never spurned the needing from thy door&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Door of thy heart, which is a palace-gate);<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Temperate and faithful,&mdash;in whose word the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might trust, sure to repay; unvexed by care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unawed by Fortune's nod, slave to no lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor coward to thy peers,&mdash;long shalt thou live!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not in this feeble verse, this sleeping age,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in the roll of Heaven, and at the bar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that high court where Virtue is in place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There thou shalt fitly rule, and read the laws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that supremer state,&mdash;writ Jove's behest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even old Saturn's chronicle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Works ne'er Hesiod saw,&mdash;types of all things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And portraitures of all&mdash;whose golden leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roll back the ages' doors, and summon up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unsleeping truths, by which wheels on Heaven's prime."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In these majestic lines, suggestive of
Dante, of Shakespeare, and of Milton, yet
fitting, by the force of imagination, to the
simplicity and magnanimity that Thoreau
had displayed, one reads the secret of that
character which made the Concord recluse
first declare to the world the true mission of
John Brown, whose friend he had been for
a few years. Of Alcott and of Hawthorne,
of Margaret Fuller and Horace Greeley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
he had been longer the friend; and in the
year before he met Brown he had stood face
to face with Walt Whitman in Brooklyn.
Mr. Alcott's testimony to Thoreau's worth
and friendliness has been constant.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"If I were to proffer my earnest prayer to the
gods for the greatest of all human privileges," he
said one day, after returning from an evening
spent at Walden with Thoreau, "it should be for
the gift of a severely candid friend. To most, the
presence of such is painfully irksome; they are
lovers of present reputation, and not of that exaltation
of soul which friends and discourse were
given to awaken and cherish in us. Intercourse
of this kind I have found possible with my friends
Emerson and Thoreau; and the evenings passed
in their society during these winter months have
realized my conception of what friendship, when
great and genuine, owes to and takes from its
objects."</p></div>

<p>Not less emphatic was Thoreau's praise
of Mr. Alcott, after these long winter evenings
with him in the hut:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"One of the last of the philosophers," he
writes in "Walden,"&mdash;"Connecticut gave him
to the world,&mdash;he peddled first her wares, afterwards,
as he declares, his brains. These he peddles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
still, prompting God and disgracing man,
bearing for fruit his brain only, like the nut its
kernel. I think he must be the man of the most
faith of any alive. His words and attitude always
suppose a better state of things than other men
are acquainted with, and he will be the last man
to be disappointed as the ages revolve. He has
no venture in the present. But though comparatively
disregarded now, laws unsuspected by
most will take effect, and masters of families and
rulers will come to him for advice. A true friend
of man; almost the only friend of human progress.
He is perhaps the sanest man and has the
fewest crotchets of any I chance to know,&mdash;the
same yesterday, to-day, and to-morrow. Of yore
we had sauntered and talked, and effectually put
the world behind us; for he was pledged to no
institution in it, freeborn, <em>ingenuus</em>. Great
Looker! great Expecter! to converse with
whom was a New England Night's Entertainment.
Ah! such discourse we had, hermit and
philosopher, and the old settler I have spoken of,&mdash;we
three,&mdash;it expanded and racked my little
house."</p></div>

<p>Nor did Thoreau participate in such discourse
at Walden alone, but frequented Mr.
Alcott's conversations at Mr. Emerson's
house in Concord, at Hawthorne's in Salem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
at Marston Watson's in Plymouth,
at Daniel Ricketson's in New Bedford, and
once or twice in Boston and New York.
With Mr. Alcott and Alice Carey, Thoreau
visited Horace Greeley at Chappaqua,
in 1856, and with Mr. Alcott alone he
called on Walt Whitman in Brooklyn the
same year.</p>

<p>Between Hawthorne and Thoreau, Ellery
Channing was perhaps the interpreter, for
they had not very much in common, though
friendly and mutually respectful. The boat
in which Thoreau made his voyage of 1839,
on the Concord and Merrimac, came afterwards
into Hawthorne's possession, and
was the frequent vehicle for Channing and
Hawthorne as they made those excursions
which Hawthorne has commemorated.
Channing also has commemorated those
years when Hawthorne spent the happiest
hours of his life in the Old Manse, to which
he had removed soon after his marriage in
1842:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">Like some still rock looked out upon the scene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As much a part of nature as itself."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In July, 1860, writing to his sister Sophia,
among the New Hampshire mountains,
Thoreau said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Mr. Hawthorne has come home. I went to
meet him the other evening (at Mr. Emerson's),
and found that he had not altered, except that he
was looking pretty brown after his voyage. He
is as simple and childlike as ever."</p></div>

<p>This was upon the return of Hawthorne
from his long residence abroad, in England,
Portugal, and Italy. Thoreau died
two years before Hawthorne, and they are
buried within a few feet of each other in
the Concord cemetery, their funerals having
proceeded from the same parish church
near by.</p>

<p>Of Thoreau's relations with Emerson,
this is not the place to speak in full; it
was, however, the most important, if not
the most intimate, of all his friendships,
and that out of which the others mainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
grew. Their close acquaintance began in
1837. In the latter part of April, 1841,
Thoreau became an inmate of Mr. Emerson's
house, and remained there till, in the
spring of 1843, he went for a few months
to be the tutor of Mr. William Emerson's
sons at Staten Island. In 1840, while
teaching school in Concord, Thoreau seems
to have been fully admitted into that circle
of which Emerson, Alcott, and Margaret
Fuller were the leaders. In May, 1840,
this circle met, as it then did frequently,
at the house of Mr. Emerson, to converse
on "the inspiration of the Prophet and
Bard, the nature of Poetry, and the causes
of the sterility of Poetic Inspiration in our
age and country." Mr. Alcott, in his diary,
has preserved a record of this meeting, and
some others of the same kind. It seems
that on this occasion&mdash;Thoreau being not
quite twenty-three years old, Mr. Alcott
forty-one, Mr. Emerson thirty-seven, and
Miss Fuller thirty&mdash;all these were present,
and also Jones Very, the Salem poet,
Dr. F. H. Hedge, Dr. C. A. Bartol, Dr.
Caleb Stetson, and Robert Bartlett of
Plymouth. Bartlett and Very were graduates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
of Harvard a year before Thoreau,
and afterwards tutors there; indeed, all the
company except Alcott were Cambridge
scholars,&mdash;for Margaret Fuller, without entering
college, had breathed in the learned
air of Cambridge, and gone beyond the students
who were her companions. I find no
earlier record of Thoreau's participation in
these meetings; but afterward he was often
present. In May, 1839, Mr. Alcott had
held one of his conversations at the house
of Thoreau's mother, but no mention is
made of Henry taking part in it. At a
conversation in Concord in 1846, one April
evening, Thoreau came in from his Walden
hermitage, and protested with some vehemence
against Mr. Alcott's declaration that
Jesus "stood in a more tender and intimate
nearness to the heart of mankind than any
character in life or literature." Thoreau
thought he "asserted this claim for the fair
Hebrew in exaggeration"; yet he could say
in the "Week," "It is necessary not to be
Christian to appreciate the beauty and significance
of the life of Christ."</p>

<p>This earliest of his volumes, like most of
his writings, is a record of his friendships,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
and in it we find that high-toned, paradoxical
essay on Love and Friendship, which
has already been quoted. To read this literally,
as Channing says, "would be to accuse
him of stupidity; he gossips there of
a high, imaginary world." But its tone is
no higher than was the habitual feeling of
Thoreau towards his friends, or that sentiment
which he inspired in them. In Mr.
Alcott's diary for March 16, 1847, he writes,
two years before the "Week" was made
public:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"This evening I pass with Thoreau at his hermitage
on Walden, and he reads me some passages
from his manuscript volume, entitled 'A
Week on the Concord and Merrimac Rivers.'
The book is purely American, fragrant with the
life of New England woods and streams, and could
have been written nowhere else. Especially am
I touched by his sufficiency and soundness, his
aboriginal vigor,&mdash;as if a man had once more
come into Nature who knew what Nature meant
him to do with her,&mdash;Virgil, and White of Selborne,
and Izaak Walton, and Yankee settler all
in one. I came home at midnight, through the
woody snow-paths, and slept with the pleasing
dream that presently the press would give me
two books to be proud of&mdash;Emerson's 'Poems,'
and Thoreau's 'Week.'"</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>This high anticipation of the young author's
career was fully shared by Emerson
himself, who everywhere praised the genius
of Thoreau; and when in England in 1848,
listened readily to a proposition from Dr.
Chapman the publisher, for a new magazine
to be called "The Atlantic," and printed at
the same time in London and in Boston,
whose chief contributors in England should
be Froude, Garth Wilkinson, Arthur Hugh
Clough, and perhaps Carlyle; and in New
England, Emerson, Thoreau, Alcott, the
Channings, Theodore Parker, and Elliott
Cabot. The plan came to nothing, but it
may have been some reminiscence of it
which, nine years afterward, gave its name
to that Boston magazine, the "Atlantic
Monthly." Mr. Emerson's letter was dated
in London, April 20, 1848, and said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I find Chapman very anxious to publish a
journal common to Old and New England, as
was long ago proposed. Froude and Clough and
other Oxonians would gladly conspire. Let the
'Massachusetts Quarterly' give place to this, and
we should have two legs, and bestride the sea.
Here I know so many good-minded people that
I am sure will gladly combine. But what do I,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
or does any friend of mine in America care for a
journal? Not enough, I fear, to secure an energetic
work on that side. I have a letter from
Cabot lately and do write him to-day. 'Tis certain
the Massachusetts 'Quarterly Review' will
fail, unless Henry Thoreau, and Alcott, and
Channing and Newcome, the fourfold visages, fly
to the rescue. I am sorry that Alcott's editor,
the Dumont of our Bentham, the Baruch of our
Jeremiah, is so slow to be born."</p></div>

<p>In 1846, before Mr. Emerson went abroad,
we find Thoreau (whose own hut beside
Walden had been built and inhabited for a
year) sketching a design for a lodge which
Mr. Emerson then proposed to build on the
opposite shore. It was to be a retreat for
study and writing, at the summit of a ledge,
with a commanding prospect over the level
country, towards Monadnoc and Wachusett
in the west and northwest. For this lookout
Mr. Alcott added a story to Thoreau's
sketch; but the hermitage was never built,
and the plan finally resulted in a rustic summer-house,
erected by Alcott with some aid
from Thoreau, in Mr. Emerson's garden, in
1847-48.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>Humbler friends than poets and philosophers
sometimes shared the companionship
of these brethren in Concord. In February,
1847, Mr. Alcott, who was then a
woodman, laboring on his hillside with his
own axe, where afterwards Hawthorne wandered
and mused, thus notes in his diary an
incident not unusual in the town:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Our friend the fugitive, who has shared now
a week's hospitalities with us (sawing and piling
my wood), feels this new trust of Freedom yet
unsafe here in New England, and so has left us
this morning for Canada. We supplied him
with the means of journeying, and bade him Godspeed
to a freer land. His stay with us has
given image and a name to the dire entity of
slavery."</p></div>

<p>It was this slave, no doubt, who had
lodged for a while in Thoreau's Walden
hut.</p>

<p>My own acquaintance with Thoreau did
not begin with our common hostility to
slavery, which afterwards brought us most
closely together, but sprang from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> accident
of my editing for a few weeks the
"Harvard Magazine," a college monthly, in
1854-55, in which appeared a long review
of "Walden" and the "Week." In acknowledgment
of this review, which was laudatory
and made many quotations from his
two volumes, Thoreau, whom I had never
seen, called at my room in Holworthy Hall,
Cambridge, in January, 1855, and left there
in my absence, a copy of the "Week" with
a message implying it was for the writer
of the magazine article. It so happened
that I was in the College Library when
Thoreau was calling on me, and when he
came, directly after, to the Library, some
one present pointed him out to me as the
author of "Walden." I was then a senior
in college, and soon to go on my winter
vacation; in course of which I wrote to
Thoreau from my native town, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="datesig">
"<span class="smcap">Hampton Falls, N. H.</span>, <em>Jan'y</em> 30th, '55.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have had it in mind to
write you a letter ever since the day when you
visited me, without my knowing it, at Cambridge.
I saw you afterward at the Library, but refrained
from introducing myself to you, in the hope that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
I should see you later in the day. But as I did
not, will you allow me to seek you out, when
next I come to Concord?</p>

<p>"The author of the criticism in the 'Harvard
Magazine' is Mr. Morton of Plymouth, a friend
and pupil of your friend, Marston Watson, of
that old town. Accordingly I gave him the book
which you left with me, judging that it belonged
to him. He received it with delight, as a gift of
value in itself, and the more valuable for the
sake of the giver.</p>

<p>"We who at Cambridge look toward Concord
as a sort of Mecca for our pilgrimages, are glad
to see that your last book finds such favor with
the public. It has made its way where your name
has rarely been heard before, and the inquiry,
'Who is Mr. Thoreau?' proves that the book has
in part done its work. For my own part, I thank
you for the new light it shows me the aspects of
Nature in, and for the marvelous beauty of your
descriptions. At the same time, if any one should
ask me what I think of your philosophy, I
should be apt to answer that it is not worth a
straw. Whenever again you visit Cambridge,
be assured, sir, that it would give me much pleasure
to see you at my room. There, or in Concord,
I hope soon to see you; if I may intrude
so much on your time.</p>

<p>"Believe me always, yours very truly,</p>

<p class="author">
"<span class="smcap">F. B. Sanborn</span>."<br />
</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>This note, which I had entirely forgotten,
and of which I trust my friend soon forgave
the pertness, came to me recently among his
papers; with one exception, it is the only
letter that passed between us, I think, in
an acquaintance of more than seven years.
Some six weeks after its date, I went to
live in Concord, and happened to take
rooms in Mr. Channing's house, just across
the way from Thoreau's. I met him more
than once in March, 1855, but he did not
call on my sister and me until the 11th of
April, when I made the following brief
note of his appearance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"To-night we had a call from Mr. Thoreau,
who came at eight and stayed till ten. He talked
about Latin and Greek&mdash;which he thought
ought to be studied&mdash;and about other things.
In his tones and gestures he seemed to me to
imitate Emerson, so that it was annoying to listen
to him, though he said many good things. He
looks like Emerson, too,&mdash;coarser, but with
something of that serenity and sagacity which E.
has. Thoreau looks eminently <em>sagacious</em>&mdash;like
a sort of wise, wild beast. He dresses plainly,
wears a beard in his throat, and has a brown
complexion."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>A month or two later my diary expanded
this sketch a little, with other particulars:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"He is a little under size, with a huge Emersonian
nose, bluish gray eyes, brown hair, and
a ruddy weather-beaten face, which reminds me
of some shrewd and honest animal's&mdash;some retired
philosophical woodchuck or magnanimous
fox. He dresses very plainly, wears his collar
turned over like Mr. Emerson" [we young collegians
then wearing ours upright], "and often
an old dress-coat, broad in the skirts, and by no
means a fit. He walks about with a brisk, rustic
air, and never seems tired."</p></div>

<p>Notwithstanding the slow admiration that
these trivial comments indicated, our friendship
grew apace, and for two years or more
I dined with him almost daily, and often
joined in his walks and river voyages, or
swam with him in some of our numerous
Concord waters. In 1857 I introduced
John Brown to him, then a guest at my
house; and in 1859, the evening before
Brown's last birthday, we listened together
to the old captain's last speech in the Concord
Town Hall. The events of that year
and the next brought us closely together,
and I found him the stanchest of friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>This chapter might easily be extended
into a volume, so long was the list of his
companions, and so intimate and perfect his
relation with them, at least on his own
side.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A truth-speaker he," said Emerson at his
funeral, "capable of the most deep and strict
conversation; a physician to the wounds of any
soul; a friend, knowing not only the secret of
friendship, but almost worshipped by those few
persons who resorted to him as their confessor
and prophet, and knew the deep value of his
mind and great heart. His soul was made for
the noblest society; he had in a short life exhausted
the capabilities of this world; wherever
there is knowledge, wherever there is virtue,
wherever there is beauty, he will find a home."</p></div>

THE WALDEN HERMITAGE.</h2>


<p>It is by his two years' encampment on
the shore of a small lake in the Walden
woods, a mile south of Concord village, that
Thoreau is best known to the world; and
the book which relates how he lived and
what he saw there is still, as it always was,
the most popular of his writings. Like all
his books, it contains much that might as
well have been written on any other subject;
but it also describes charmingly the
scenes and events of his sylvan life,&mdash;his
days and nights with Nature. He spent
two years and a half in this retreat, though
often coming forth from it.</p>

<p>The localities of Concord which Thoreau
immortalized were chiefly those in the
neighborhood of some lake or stream,&mdash;though
it would be hard to find in that
well-watered town, especially in springtime,
any place which is not neighbor either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
to the nine-times circling river Musketaquid,
to the swifter Assabet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"That like an arrowe clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through Troy rennest aie downward to the sea,"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>to Walden or White Pond, to Bateman's
Pond, to the Mill Brook, the Sanguinetto,
the Nut-Meadow, or the Second Division
Brook. All these waters and more are renowned
again and again in Thoreau's books.
Like Icarus, the ancient high-flyer, he tried
his fortune upon many a river, fiord, streamlet,
and broad sea,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where still the shore his brave attempt resounds."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>He gave beauty and dignity to obscure
places by his mention of them; and it is
curious that the neighborhood of Walden,&mdash;now
the most romantic and poetical region
of Concord, associated in every mind with
this tender lover of Nature, and his worship
of her,&mdash;was anciently a place of
dark repute, the home of pariahs and lawless
characters, such as fringed the sober
garment of many a New England village in
Puritanic times.</p>

<p>Close by Walden is Brister's Hill, where,
in the early days of emancipation in Massachusetts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
the newly freed slaves of Concord
magnates took up their abode,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The wrathful kings on cairns apart,"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>as Ossian says. Here dwelt Cato Ingraham,
freedman of 'Squire Duncan Ingraham,
who, when yet a slave in his master's backyard,
on the day of Concord fight, was
brought to a halt by the fierce Major Pitcairn,
then something the worse for 'Squire
Ingraham's wine, and ordered to "lay down
his arms and disperse," as the rebels at
Lexington had been six hours earlier. Here
also abode Zilpha, a black Circe, who spun
linen, and made the Walden Woods resound
with her shrill singing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Dives inaccessos ubi Solis filia lucos<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assiduo resonat cantu, tectisque superbis<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Urit odoratam nocturna in lumina cedrum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arguto tenues percurrens pectine telas."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But some paroled English prisoners in the
War of 1812, burnt down her proud abode,
with its imprisoned cat and dog and hens,
while Zilpha was absent. Down the road
towards the village from Cato's farm and
Zilpha's musical loom and wheel, lived
Brister Freeman, who gave his name to
the hill,&mdash;Scipio Brister, "a handy negro,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
once the slave of 'Squire Cummings,
but long since emancipated, and in Thoreau's
boyhood set free again by death, and
buried in an old Lincoln graveyard, near
the ancestor of President Garfield, but still
nearer the unmarked graves of British grenadiers,
who fell in the retreat from Concord.
With this Scipio Africanus Brister Libertinus,
in the edge of the Walden Woods,
"dwelt Fenda, his hospitable wife, who
told fortunes, yet pleasantly&mdash;large, round,
and black,&mdash;such a dusky orb as never
rose on Concord, before or since," says
Thoreau. Such was the African colony on
the south side of Concord village among
the woods, while on the northern edge of
the village, along the Great Meadows, there
dwelt another colony, headed by Cæsar Robbins,
whose descendants still flit about the
town. Older than all was the illustrious
Guinea negro, John Jack, once a slave on
the farm which is now the glebe of the Old
Manse, but who purchased his freedom
about the time the Old Manse was built in
1765-66. He survives in his quaint epitaph,
written by Daniel Bliss, the young
Tory brother of the first mistress of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
manse (Mrs. William Emerson, grandmother
of Emerson, the poet):&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p>This epitaph, and the anecdote already
given concerning Cæsar Robbins, may illustrate
the humanity and humor with which
the freedmen of Concord were regarded,
while an adventure of Scipio Brister's, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
his early days of freedom, may show the
mixture of savage fun and contempt that
also followed them, and which some of their
conduct may have deserved.</p>

<p>The village drover and butcher once had
a ferocious bull to kill, and when he had
succeeded with some difficulty in driving
him into his slaughter-house, on the Walden
road, nobody was willing to go in and
kill him. Just then Brister Freeman, from
his hill near Walden, came along the road,
and was slyly invited by the butcher to go
into the slaughter-house for an axe,&mdash;being
told that when he brought it he should have
a job to do. The unsuspecting freedman
opened the door and walked in; it was shut
behind him, and he found the bull drawn up
in line of battle before him. After some
pursuit and retreat in the narrow arena,
Brister spied the axe he wanted, and began
attacking his pursuer, giving him a blow
here or there as he had opportunity. His
employers outside watched the bull-fight
through a hole in the building, and cheered
on the matador with shouts and laughter.
At length, by a fortunate stroke, the African
conquered, the bull fell, and his slayer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
threw down the axe and rushed forth unhurt.
But his tormentors declared "he was
no longer the dim, sombre negro he went
in, but literally white with terror, and what
was once his wool straightened out and
standing erect on his head." Without waiting
to be identified, or to receive pay for
his work, Brister, affrighted and wrathful,
withdrew to the wooded hill and to the
companionship of his fortune-telling Fenda,
who had not foreseen the hazard of her
spouse.</p>

<p>It was along the same road and down
this hill, passing by the town "poor-farm"
and poor-house,&mdash;the last retreat of these
straggling soldiers of fortune,&mdash;that Thoreau
went toward the village jail from his
hermitage, that day in 1846, when the town
constable carried him off from the shoemaker's
to whose shop he had gone to get
a cobbled shoe. His room-mate in jail for
the single night he slept there, was introduced
to him by the jailer, Mr. Staples (a
real name), as "a first-rate fellow and a
clever man," and on being asked by Thoreau
why he was in prison, replied, "Why,
they accuse me of burning a barn, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
never did it." As near as Thoreau could
make out, he had gone to bed in a barn
when drunk, and smoked his pipe there.
Such were the former denizens of the Walden
woods&mdash;votaries of Bacchus and Apollo,
and extremely liable to take fire upon
small occasion,&mdash;like Giordano Bruno's
sonneteer, who, addressing the Arabian
Phenix, says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<em>Tu bruci 'n un, ed io in ogni loco,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Io da Cupido, hai tu da Febo il foco</em>."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It seems by the letter of Margaret Fuller
in 1841 (cited in chapter <a href="#Margaret_Fuller">VI</a>.), that Thoreau
had for years meditated a withdrawal
to a solitary life. The retreat he then had
in view was, doubtless, the Hollowell Farm,
a place, as he says, "of complete retirement,
being about two miles from the village,
half a mile from the nearest neighbor,
and separated from the highway by a broad
field." The house stood apart from the
road to Nine-Acre Corner, fronting the
Musketaquid on a green hill-side, and was
first seen by Thoreau as a boy, in his earliest
voyages up the river to Fairhaven
Bay, "concealed behind a dense grove of
red maples, through which I heard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
house-dog bark." This place Thoreau once
bought, but released it to the owner, whose
wife refused to sign the deed of sale. In
his Walden venture he was a squatter, using
for his house-lot a woodland of Mr. Emerson's,
who, for the sake of his walks and his
wood-fire, had bought land on both sides of
Walden Pond.</p>

<p>How early Thoreau formed his plan of
retiring to a hut among these woods, I have
not learned; but in a letter written to him
March 5, 1845, by his friend Channing, a
passage occurs concerning it; and it was in
the latter part of the same month that Thoreau
borrowed Mr. Alcott's axe and went
across the fields to cut the timber for his
cabin. Channing writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I see nothing for you in this earth but that
field which I once christened 'Briars;' go out
upon that, build yourself a hut, and there begin
the grand process of devouring yourself alive. I
see no alternative, no other hope for you. Eat
yourself up; you will eat nobody else, nor anything
else. Concord is just as good a place as
any other; there are, indeed, more people in the
streets of that village than in the streets of this."
[He was writing from the Tribune Office, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
New York.] "This is a singularly muddy town;
muddy, solitary, and silent. I saw Teufelsdröckh
a few days since; he said a few words to me
about you. Says he, 'That fellow Thoreau
might be something, if he would only take a
journey through the Everlasting No, thence for
the North Pole. By G&mdash;,' said the old clothes-bag,
warming up, 'I should like to take that fellow
out into the Everlasting No, and explode him
like a bombshell; he would make a loud report;
it would be fun to see him pick himself up.
He needs the Blumine flower business; that
would be his salvation. He is too dry, too composed,
too chalky, too concrete. Does that execrable
compound of sawdust and stagnation L.
still prose about nothing? and that nutmeg-grater
of a Z. yet shriek about nothing? Does
anybody still think of coming to Concord to live?
I mean new people? If they do, let them beware
of you philosophers.'"</p></div>

<p>Of course, this imaginary Teufelsdröckh,
like Carlyle's, was the satirical man in the
writer himself, suggesting the humorous
and contradictory side of things, and glancing
at the coolness of Thoreau, which his
friends sometimes found provoking. In his
own person Channing adds:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>"I should be pleased to hear from Kamchatka
occasionally; my last advices from the Polar
Bear are getting stale. In addition to this I find
that my corresponding members at Van Diemen's
Land have wandered into limbo. I hear occasionally
from the World; everything seems to
be promising in that quarter; business is flourishing,
and the people are in good spirits. I feel
convinced that the Earth has less claims to our
regard than formerly; these mild winters deserve
severe censure. But I am well aware that the
Earth will talk about the necessity of routine,
taxes, etc. On the whole it is best not to complain
without necessity."</p></div>

<p>It is well to read this shrewd humor,
uttered in the opposite sense from Thoreau's
paradoxical wit in his "Walden," as an introduction
or motto to that book. For
Thoreau has been falsely judged from the
wit and the paradox of "Walden," as if he
were a hater of men, or foolishly desired all
mankind to retire to the woods. As Channing
said, soon after his friend's death,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The fact that our author lived for a while
alone in a shanty, near a pond, and named one
of his books after the place where it stood, has
led some to say he was a barbarian or a misanthrope.
It was a writing-case; here in this
wooden inkstand he wrote a good part of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
famous 'Walden,' and this solitary woodland
pool was more to his Muse than all oceans of the
planet, by the force of imagination. Some have
fancied, because he moved to Walden, he left his
family. He bivouacked there and really lived
at home, where he went every day."</p></div>

<p>This last is not literally true, for he was
sometimes secluded in his hut for days together;
but he remained as social at Walden
as he had been while an inmate of Mr.
Emerson's family in 1841-43, or again in
1847-48, after giving up his hermitage. He,
in fact, as he says himself,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Went to the woods because he wished to live
deliberately, to front only the essential facts of
life, and see if he could not learn what it had to
teach, and not, when he came to die, discover
that he had not lived."</p></div>

<p>In another place he says he went to
Walden to "transact some private business,"
and this he did to good purpose. He
edited there his "Week," some portions of
which had appeared in the "Dial" from
1840 to 1844, but which was not published
as a volume until 1849, although he had
made many attempts to issue it earlier. It
was at Walden, also, that he wrote his essay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
on Carlyle, which was first published in
"Graham's Magazine," at Philadelphia, in
1847, through the good offices of Horace
Greeley, of which we shall hear more in the
next chapter.</p>

<p>Thoreau's hermit life was not, then,
merely a protest against the luxury and the
restraints of society, nor yet an austere
discipline such as monks and saints have
imposed upon themselves for their souls'
good. "My purpose in going to Walden
was not to live cheaply, nor to live dearly
there, but to transact some private business
with the fewest obstacles." He lived a
life of labor and study in his hut. Emerson
says, "as soon as he had exhausted the
advantages of that solitude, he abandoned
it." He had edited his first book there;
had satisfied himself that he was fit to be
an author, and had passed his first examinations;
then he graduated from that gymnasium
as another young student might
from the medical college or the polytechnic
school. "I left the woods for as good a
reason as I went there." His abandoned
hut was then taken by a Scotch gardener,
Hugh Whelan by name, who removed it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
some rods away, to the midst of Thoreau's
bean-field, and made it his cottage for a few
years. Then it was bought by a farmer,
who put it on wheels and carried it three
miles northward, toward the entry of the
Estabrook Farm on the old Carlisle road,
where it stood till after Thoreau's death,&mdash;a
shelter for corn and beans, and a favorite
haunt of squirrels and blue jays. The
wood-cut representing the hermitage in the
first edition of "Walden," is from a sketch
made by Sophia Thoreau, and is more exact
than that given in Page's "Life of Thoreau,"
but in neither picture are the trees
accurately drawn.</p>

<p>On the spot where Thoreau lived at Walden
there is now a cairn of stones, yearly
visited by hundreds, and growing in height
as each friend of his muse adds a stone from
the shore of the fair water he loved so
well.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>The events and thoughts of Thoreau's
life at Walden may be read in his book of
that name. As a protest against society,
that life was ineffectual,&mdash;as the communities
at Brook Farm and Fruitlands had
proved to be; and as the Fourierite phalansteries,
in which Horace Greeley interested
himself, were destined to be. In one sense,
all these were failures; but in Thoreau's
case the failure was slight, the discipline
and experience gained were invaluable. He
never regretted it, and the Walden episode
in his career has made him better known
than anything else.</p>

HORACE IN THE RÔLE OF MÆCENAS.</h2>


<p>In a letter to his sister Sophia, July 21,
1843, written from Mr. William Emerson's
house at Staten Island, Thoreau says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In New York I have seen, since I wrote last,
Horace Greeley, editor of the 'Tribune,' who is
cheerfully in earnest at his office of all work,&mdash;a
hearty New Hampshire boy as one would wish
to meet,&mdash;and says, 'Now be neighborly.' He
believes only or mainly, first in the Sylvania Association,
somewhere in Pennsylvania; and secondly,
and most of all, in a new association, to
go into operation soon in New Jersey, with which
he is connected."</p></div>

<p>This was the "Phalanstery" at which
W. H. Channing afterward preached. A
fortnight later, Thoreau writes to Mr. Emerson:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have had a pleasant talk with W. H. Channing;
and Greeley, too, it was refreshing to meet.
They were both much pleased with your criticism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
on Carlyle, but thought that you had overlooked
what chiefly concerned them in the book,&mdash;its
practical aims and merits."</p></div>

<p>This refers to the notice of Carlyle's
"Past and Present," in the "Dial" for
July, 1843, and shows that Mr. Greeley
was a quick reader of that magazine, as
Thoreau always was of the "New York
Tribune." From this time onward a
warm friendship continued between Thoreau
and Greeley, and many letters went
to and fro, which reveal the able editor in
the light of a modern Mæcenas to the author
of the Musketaquid Georgics.</p>

<p>No letters seem to have passed between
them earlier than 1846; and in 1844-45
Thoreau must have known the "Tribune"
editor best through his newspaper, and
from the letters of Margaret Fuller, Ellery
Channing, and other common friends, who
saw much of him then, admired and laughed
at him, or did both by turns. Miss Fuller,
who had gone to New York to write for the
"Tribune," and to live in its Editor's family,
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Mr. Greeley is a man of genuine excellence,
honorable, benevolent, and of an uncorrupted disposition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
He is sagacious, and, in his way, of
even great abilities. In modes of life and manners,
he is a man of the people,&mdash;and of the
American people. With the exception of my
own mother, I think him the most disinterestedly
generous person I have ever known."</p></div>

<p>There was a laughable side even to these
fine traits, and there were eccentricities of
dress and manner, which others saw more
keenly than this generous woman. Ellery
Channing,&mdash;whose eye no whimsical or
beautiful object ever escaped,&mdash;in the letter
of March, 1845, already cited, thus signaled
to Thoreau the latest news of his friend:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Mumbo Jumbo is recovering from an attack
of sore eyes, and will soon be out, in a pair of
canvas trousers, scarlet jacket, and cocked hat.
I understand he intends to demolish all the remaining
species of Fetichism at a meal. I think
it is probable it will vomit him."</p></div>

<p>Thoreau wrote an essay on Carlyle in
1846, and in the summer of that year sent
it to Mr. Greeley, with a request that he
would find a place for it in some magazine.
To this request, which Mr. Greeley himself
had invited, no doubt, he thus replied:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="datesig">
"<em>August 16, 1846.</em>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Thoreau</span>,&mdash;Believe me when I
say that I <em>mean</em> to do the errand you have asked
of me, and that soon. But I am not sanguine of
success, and have hardly a hope that it will be
immediate, if ever. I hardly know a work that
would publish your article all at once, and 'to be
continued' are words shunned like a pestilence.
But I know you have written a good thing about
Carlyle,&mdash;too solidly good, I fear, to be profitable
to yourself, or attractive to publishers.
Did'st thou ever, O my friend! ponder on the
significance and cogency of the assurance, 'Ye
cannot serve God and Mammon,' as applicable to
literature,&mdash;applicable, indeed, to all things whatsoever?
God grant us grace to endeavor to serve
Him rather than Mammon,&mdash;that ought to suffice
us. In my poor judgment, if anything is
calculated to make a scoundrel of an honest man,
writing to sell is that very particular thing.</p>

<p class="salusig">
"Yours heartily,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Horace Greeley</span>.<br />
</p>

<p>"Remind Ralph Waldo Emerson and wife of
my existence and grateful remembrance."</p></div>

<p>On the 30th of September Mr. Greeley
again wrote, saying,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I learned to-day, through Mr. Griswold,
former editor of 'Graham's Magazine,' that your
lecture is accepted, to appear in that magazine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
Of course it is to be paid for at the usual rate, as
I expressly so stated when I inclosed it to Graham.
He has not written me a word on the
subject, which induces me to think he may have
written you.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Please write me if you would have
me speak further on the subject. The pay, however,
is sure, though the amount may not be
large, and I think you may wait until the article
appears, before making further stipulations on
the subject."</p></div>

<p>From the tenor of this I infer that Thoreau
had written to say that he might wish
to read his "Thomas Carlyle" as a lecture,
and desired to stipulate for that before it
was printed. He might be excused for
some solicitude concerning payment, from
his recent experience with the publishers of
the "Boston Miscellany," which had printed,
in 1843, his "Walk to Wachusett." At
the very time when Thoreau, in New York,
was making Greeley's acquaintance, Mr.
Emerson, in Boston, was dunning the Miscellaneous
publishers, and wrote to Thoreau
(July 20, 1843):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"When I called on &mdash;&mdash;, their partner, in their
absence, informed me that they could not pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
you, at present, any part of their debt on account
of the Boston 'Miscellany.' After much talking
all the promise he could offer was, 'that
within a year it would probably be paid,'&mdash;a
probability which certainly looks very slender.
The very worst thing he said was the proposition
that you should take your payment in the form
of Boston Miscellanies! I shall not fail to refresh
their memory at intervals."</p></div>

<p>But I cannot learn that anything came
of it. Mr. Greeley, as we shall see, was a
more successful collector. On the 26th of
October, 1846, he continued the adventures
of the wandering essay as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Friend Thoreau</span>,&mdash;I know you think
it odd that you have not heard further, and, perhaps
blame my negligence or engrossing cares,
but, if so, without good reason. I have to-day
received a letter from Griswold, in Philadelphia,
who says: 'The article by Thoreau on Carlyle
is in type, and will be paid for liberally.' 'Liberally'
is quoted as an expression of Graham's.
I know well the difference between a publisher's
and an author's idea of what <em>is</em> 'liberally'; but
I give you the best I can get as the result of
three letters to Philadelphia on this subject.</p>

<p>"Success to you, my friend! Remind Mr. and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Mrs. Emerson of my existence, and my lively
remembrance of their various kindnesses.</p>

<p>"Yours, very busy in our political contest,</p>

<p class="author">
"<span class="smcap">Horace Greeley</span>."<br />
</p></div>

<p>It would seem that "Griswold" (who was
Rufus W. Griswold, the biographer of
Poe) and "Graham" (who was George
R. Graham, the magazine publisher of Philadelphia),
did not move so fast either in
publication or in payment as they had led
Mr. Greeley to expect; and also that Thoreau
became impatient and wrote to his
friend that he would withdraw the essay.
Whereupon Mr. Greeley, under date of February
5, 1847, wrote thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Thoreau</span>,&mdash;Although your letter
only came to hand to-day, I attended to its subject
yesterday, when I was in Philadelphia, on
my way home from Washington. Your article
is this moment in type, and will appear about
the 20th inst., <em>as the leading article</em> in 'Graham's
Magazine' for next month. Now don't object
to this, nor be unreasonably sensitive at the delay.
It is immensely more important to you
that the article should appear thus (that is, if you
have any literary aspirations) than it is that you
should make a few dollars by issuing it in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
other way. As to lecturing, you have been at
perfect liberty to deliver it as a lecture a hundred
times, if you had chosen,&mdash;the more the
better. It is really a good thing, and I will see
that Graham pays you fairly for it. But its appearance
there is worth far more to you than
money. I know there has been too much delay,
and have done my best to obviate it. But I
could not. A magazine that pays, and which it
is desirable to be known as a contributor to, is
always crowded with articles, and has to postpone
some for others of even less merit. I do this
myself with good things that I am not required
to pay for.</p>

<p>"Thoreau, do not think hard of Graham. Do
not try to stop the publication of your article. It
is best as it is. But just sit down and write a
like article about Emerson, which I will give
you $25 for, if you cannot do better with it;
then one about Hawthorne at your leisure, etc.,
etc. I will pay you the money for each of these
articles on delivery, publish them when and
how I please, leaving to you the copyright expressly.
In a year or two, if you take care not
to write faster than you think, you will have the
material of a volume worth publishing,&mdash;and
then we will see what can be done. There is a
text somewhere in St. Paul&mdash;my Scriptural
reading is getting rusty,&mdash;which says, 'Look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
not back to the things which are behind, but
rather to those which are before,' etc. Commending
this to your thoughtful appreciation, I
am, yours, etc.</p>

"<span class="smcap">Horace Greeley</span>."<br />
</p></div>

<p>The Carlyle essay did appear in two
numbers of "Graham's Magazine" (March
and April, 1847), but alas, no payment
came to hand. After waiting a year longer,
Thoreau wrote to Greeley again (March 31,
1848), informing him of the delinquency of
Griswold and Graham. At once, his friend
replied (April 3), "It saddens and surprises
me to know that your article was not
paid for by Graham; and, since my honor
is involved in the matter, I will see that you
<em>are</em> paid, and that at no distant day." Accordingly
on the 17th of May, 1848, he
writes again as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Friend Thoreau</span>,&mdash;I trust you
have not thought me neglectful or dilatory with
regard to your business. I have done my very
best, throughout, and it is only to-day that I have
been able to lay my hand on the money due you
from Graham. I have been to see him in Philadelphia,
but did not catch him in his business
office; then I have been here to meet him, and
been referred to his brother, etc. I finally found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
the two numbers of the work in which your article
was published (not easy, I assure you, for he
has them not, nor his brother, and I hunted them
up, and bought one of them at a very out-of-the-way
place), and with these I made out a regular
bill for the contribution; drew a draft on G. R.
Graham for the amount, gave it to his brother
here for collection, and to-day received the money.
Now you see how to get pay yourself, another
time; I have pioneered the way, and you can
follow it easily yourself. There has been no
intentional injustice on Graham's part; but he is
overwhelmed with business, has too many irons
in the fire, and we did not go at him the right
way. Had you drawn a draft on him, at first,
and given it to the Concord Bank to send in for
collection, you would have received your money
long since. Enough of this. I have made Graham
pay you $75, but I only send you $50, for,
having got so much for Carlyle, I am ashamed to
take your 'Maine Woods' for $25."</p></div>

<p>This last allusion is to a new phase of
the queer patronage which the good Mæcenas
extended to our Concord poet. In his
letter of March 31, 1848, Thoreau had offered
Greeley, in compliance with his suggestion
of the previous year, a paper on
"Ktaadn and the Maine Woods," which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
afterwards appeared in the "Union Magazine."
On the 17th of April Greeley
writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I inclose you $25 for your article on Maine
Scenery, as promised. I know it is worth more,
though I have not yet found time to read it; but
I have tried once to sell it without success. It
is rather long for my columns, and too fine for
the million; but I consider it a cheap bargain,
and shall print it myself, if I do not dispose of
it to better advantage. You will not, of course,
consider yourself under any sort of obligation to
me, for my offer was in the way of business,
and I have got more than the worth of my
money."</p></div>

<p>On the 17th of May he adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have expectations of procuring it a place
in a new magazine of high character that will
pay. I don't expect to get as much for it as
for Carlyle, but I hope to get $50. If you are
satisfied to take the $25 for your 'Maine
Woods,' say so, and I will send on the money;
but I don't want to seem a Jew, buying your
articles at half price to speculate upon. If you
choose to let it go that way, it shall be so; but
I would sooner do my best for you, and send you
the money."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 28th of October, 1848, he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I break a silence of some duration to inform
you that I hope on Monday to receive payment
for your glorious account of 'Ktaadn and the
Maine Woods,' which I bought of you at a
Jew's bargain, and sold to the 'Union Magazine.'
I am to get $75 for it, and, as I don't
choose to <em>exploiter</em> you at such a rate, I shall
insist on inclosing you $25 more in this letter,
which will still leave me $25 to pay various
charges and labors I have incurred in selling
your articles and getting paid for them,&mdash;the
latter by far the more difficult portion of the
business."</p></div>

<p>In the letter of April 17, 1848, Mr.
Greeley had further said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"If you will write me two or three articles in
the course of the summer, I think I can dispose
of them for your benefit. But write not more
than half as long as your article just sent me,
for that is too long for the magazines. If that
were in two, it would be far more valuable.
What about your book (the 'Week')? Is anything
going on about it now? Why did not
Emerson try it in England? I think the Howitts
could get it favorably before the British
public. If you can suggest any way wherein I
can put it forward, do not hesitate, but command
me."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>In the letter of May 17th, he reiterates
the advice to be brief:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Thoreau, if you will only write one or two
articles, when in the spirit, about half the length
of this, I can sell it readily and advantageously.
The length of your papers is the only impediment
to their appreciation by the magazines.
Give me one or two shorter, and I will try to coin
them speedily."</p></div>

<p>May 25th he returns to the charge, when
sending the last twenty-five dollars for the
"Maine Woods":&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Write me something shorter when the spirit
moves (never write a line otherwise, for the hack
writer is a slavish beast, <em>I</em> know), and I will sell
it for you soon. I want one shorter article from
your pen that will be quoted, as these long articles
cannot be, and let the public know something
of your way of thinking and seeing. It will do
good. What do you think of following out your
thought in an essay on 'The Literary Life?'
You need not make a personal allusion, but I
know you can write an article worth reading on
that theme, when you are in the vein."</p></div>

<p>After a six months' interval (November
19, 1848), Greeley resumes in a similar
strain:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Friend Thoreau</span>,&mdash;Yours of the 17th received.
Say we are even on money counts, and
let the matter drop. I have tried to serve you,
and have been fully paid for my own disbursements
and trouble in the premises. So we will
move on.</p>

<p>"I think you will do well to send me some
passages from one or both of your new works to
dispose of to the magazines. This will be the
best kind of advertisement, whether for a publisher
or for readers. You may write with an
angel's pen, yet your writings have no mercantile
money value till you are known and talked
of as an author. Mr. Emerson would have been
twice as much known and read, if he had written
for the magazines a little, just to let common
people know of his existence. I believe a chapter
from one of your books printed in 'Graham,' or
'The Union,' will add many to the readers of the
volume when issued. Here is the reason why
British books sell so much better among us than
American,&mdash;because they are thoroughly advertised
through the British reviews, magazines, and
journals which circulate or are copied among us.
However, do as you please. If you choose to
send me one of your manuscripts I will get it
published, but I cannot promise you any considerable
recompense; and, indeed, if Munroe
will do it, that will be better. Your writings are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
in advance of the general mind here; Boston is
nearer their standard. I never saw the verses
you speak of. Won't you send them again? I
have been buried up in politics for the last six
weeks. Kind regards to Emerson. It is doubtful
about my seeing you this season."</p></div>

<p>Here the letters ceased for a time. "Munroe
did it,"&mdash;that is, a Boston bookseller
published Thoreau's "Week," which was
favorably reviewed by George Ripley in
the "Tribune," by Lowell in the "Massachusetts
Quarterly," and by others elsewhere;
but the book did not sell, and involved
its author in debt for its printing.
To meet this he took up surveying as a business,
and after a time, when some payment
must be made, he asked his friend Greeley
for a loan. In the interval, Margaret Fuller
had written from Europe those remarkable
letters for the "Tribune," had married
in Italy, sailed for home in 1850, and died
on the shore of Fire Island, near New York,
whither Thoreau went with her friends to
learn her fate, and recover the loved remains.
This was in July, 1850, and he no
doubt saw Mr. Greeley there. A year and
a half later, when he was seeking opportunities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
to lecture, he wrote to Mr. Greeley
again, in February, 1852, offering himself
to lecture in a course at New York, which
the "Tribune" editor had some interest in.
The reply was this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="datesig">
"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <em>February 24, 1852</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Friend Thoreau</span>,&mdash;Thank you for
your remembrance, though the motto you suggest
is impracticable. The People's Course is
full for the season; and even if it were not, your
name would probably not pass; because it is not
merely necessary that each lecturer should continue
<em>well</em> the course, but that he shall be <em>known</em>
as the very man beforehand. Whatever draws
less than fifteen hundred hearers damages the
finances of the movement, so low is the admission,
and so large the expense. But, Thoreau,
you are a better speaker than many, but a far
better writer still. Do you wish to swap any of
your 'wood-notes wild' for dollars? If yea, and
you will sell me some articles, shorter, if you
please, than the former, I will try to coin them
for you. Is it a bargain? Yours,</p>

<p class="author">
"<span class="smcap">Horace Greeley</span>."<br />
</p></div>

<p>Thoreau responded at once with some
manuscripts (March 5), and was thus addressed,
March 18, by his friend:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I shall get you some money for the articles
you sent me, though not immediately. As to
your long account of a Canadian tour, I don't
know. It looks unmanageable. Can't you cut
it into three or four, and omit all that relates to
time? The cities are described to death; but I
know you are at home with Nature, and that <em>she</em>
rarely and slowly changes. Break this up, if
you can, and I will try to have it swallowed
and digested."</p></div>

<p>A week later he sent a letter from the
publisher, Sartain, accepting the articles for
a low price,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and adds: "If you break up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
your 'Excursion to Canada' into three or
four articles, I have no doubt I could get it
published on similar terms." April 3, 1852,
he returns to a former proposition, that Thoreau
shall write about Emerson as he did
six years before on Carlyle.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Friend Thoreau</span>,&mdash;I wish you to write me
an article on Ralph Waldo Emerson, his Works
and Ways, extending to one hundred pages,
or so, of letter sheet like this, to take the form
of a review of his writings, but to give some idea
of the Poet, the Genius, the Man,&mdash;with some
idea of the New England scenery and home influence,
which have combined to make him what
he is. Let it be calm, searching, and impartial;
nothing like adulation, but a just summing up of
what he is and what he has done. I mean to get
this into the 'Westminster Review,' but if not
acceptable there, I will publish it elsewhere. I
will pay you fifty dollars for the article when delivered;
in advance, if you desire it. Say the
word, and I will send the money at once. It is
perfectly convenient to do so. Your 'Carlyle'
article is my model, but you can give us Emerson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
better than you did Carlyle. I presume he would
allow you to write extracts for this purpose from
his lectures not yet published. I would delay the
publication of the article to suit his publishing
arrangements, should that be requested.</p>

<p class="salusig">
"Yours,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Horace Greeley</span>."<br />
</p></div>

<p>To this request, as before, there came a
prompt negative, although Thoreau was
then sadly in need of money. Mr. Greeley
wrote, April 20:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I am rather sorry you will not do the
'Works and Ways,' but glad that you are able
to employ your time to better purpose. But
your Quebec notes haven't reached me yet, and
I fear the 'good time' is passing. They ought
to have appeared in the June number of the
monthlies, but now cannot before July. If you
choose to send them to me all in a lump, I will try
to get them printed in that way. I don't care
about them if you choose to reserve, or to print
them elsewhere; but I can better make a use for
them at this season than at any other."</p></div>

<p>They were sent, and offered to the
"Whig Review," and to other magazines;
but on the 25th of June, Mr. Greeley
writes:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have had only bad luck with your manuscript.
Two magazines have refused it on the
ground of its length, saying that articles 'To be
continued' are always unpopular, however good.
I will try again."</p></div>

<p>It seems that the author had relied upon
money from this source, and a week or two
later he asks his friend to lend him the expected
seventy-five dollars, offering security,
with mercantile scrupulosity. Promptly
came this answer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="datesig">
"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <em>July 8, 1852</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Thoreau</span>,&mdash;Yours received. I was
absent yesterday. I <em>can</em> lend you the seventy-five
dollars, and am very glad to do it. Don't
talk about security. I am sorry about your MSS.,
which I do not quite despair of using to your advantage.</p>

<p class="salusig">
Yours,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Horace Greeley</span>."<br />
</p></div>

<p>The "Yankee in Canada," as it is now
called (the record of Thoreau's journey
through French Canada in September,
1850, with Ellery Channing), was offered
to "Putnam's Magazine" by Mr. Greeley,
and begun there, but ill-luck attended it.
Before it went the paper on "Cape Cod,"
which became the subject of controversy,
first as to price, and then as to its tone towards
the people of that region. This will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
explain the letters of Mr. Greeley that follow:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="datesig">
"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <em>November 23, 1852</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Thoreau</span>,&mdash;I have made no
bargain&mdash;none whatever&mdash;with Putnam concerning
your MSS. I have indicated no price
to them. I handed over the MS. because I
wished it published, and presumed that was in
accordance both with your interest and your
wishes. And I now say to you, that if he will
pay you three dollars per printed page, I think
that will be very well. I have promised to write
something for him myself, and shall be well satisfied
with that price. Your 'Canada' is not so
fresh and acceptable as if it had just been written
on the strength of a last summer's trip, and I hope
you will have it printed in 'Putnam's Monthly.'
But I have said nothing to his folks as to price,
and will not till I hear from you again. Very
probably there was some misapprehension on
the part of C. I presume the price now offered
you is that paid to writers generally for the
'Monthly.' As to Sartain, I know his '(Union)
Magazine' has broken down, but I guess he will
pay you. I have seen but one of your articles
printed by him, and I think the other may be reclaimed.
Please address him at once."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="datesig">
"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <em>January 2, 1853</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Friend Thoreau</span>,&mdash;I have yours of the
29th, and credit you $20. Pay me when and in
such sums as may be convenient. I am sorry
you and C. cannot agree so as to have your
whole MS. printed. It will be worth nothing
elsewhere after having partly appeared in Putnam's.
I think it is a mistake to conceal the authorship
of the several articles, making them all
(so to speak) <em>editorial</em>; but <em>if</em> that is done, don't
you see that the elimination of very flagrant heresies
(like your defiant Pantheism) becomes a
necessity? If you had withdrawn your MSS., on
account of the abominable misprints in the first
number, your ground would have been far more
tenable.</p>

<p>"However, do what you will. Yours,</p>

<p class="author">
"<span class="smcap">Horace Greeley</span>."<br />
</p></div>

<p>Thoreau did what he would, of course, and
the article in Putnam came to an abrupt
end. The loan made in July, 1852, was
paid with interest on the 9th of March,
1853, as the following note shows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="datesig">
"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <em>March 16, 1853</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have yours of the 9th, inclosing
Putnam's check for $59, making $79 in all
you have paid me. I am paid in full, and this
letter is your receipt in full. I don't want any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
pay for my 'services,' whatever they may have
been. Consider me your friend who <em>wished</em> to
serve you, however unsuccessfully. Don't break
with C. or Putnam."</p></div>

<p>A year later, Thoreau renewed his subscription
to the "Weekly Tribune," but
the letter miscarried. In due time came
this reply to a third letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="datesig">
"<em>March 6, 1854.</em>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I presume your first letter containing
the $2 was robbed by our general mail
robber of New Haven, who has just been sent to
the State's Prison. Your second letter has probably
failed to receive attention owing to a press
of business. But I will make all right. You
ought to have the Semi-weekly, and I shall order
it sent to you one year on trial; if you choose
to write me a letter or so some time, very well;
if not, we will be even without that.</p>

<p>"Thoreau, I want you to do something on <em>my</em>
urgency. I want you to collect and arrange your
'Miscellanies' and send them to me. Put in
'Ktaadn,' 'Carlyle,' 'A Winter Walk,' 'Canada,'
etc., and I will try to find a publisher who will
bring them out at his own risk, and (I hope) to
your ultimate profit. If you have anything new
to put with them, very well; but let me have
about a 12mo volume whenever you can get it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
ready, and see if there is not something to your
credit in the bank of Fortune. Yours,</p>

<p class="author">
"<span class="smcap">Horace Greeley</span>."<br />
</p></div>

<p>In reply, Thoreau notified his friend of
the early publication of "Walden," and was
thus met:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<em>March 23, 1854.</em></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Thoreau</span>,&mdash;I am glad your 'Walden'
is coming out. <em>I</em> shall announce it at once,
whether Ticknor does or not. I am in no hurry
now about your 'Miscellanies;' take your time,
select your title, and prepare your articles deliberately
and finally. Then, if Ticknor will give
you something worth having, let him have this
too; if proffering it to him is to glut your market,
let it come to me. But take your time. I
was only thinking you were merely waiting when
you might be doing something. I referred (without
naming you) to your 'Walden' experience
in my lecture on 'Self-Culture,' with which I
have had ever so many audiences. This episode
excited much interest, and I have been repeatedly
asked who it is that I refer to.</p>

<p class="salusig">
"Yours,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Horace Greeley</span>.<br />
</p>

<p>"P. S.&mdash;You must know Miss Elizabeth
Hoar, whereas I hardly do. Now, I have offered
to edit Margaret's works, and I want of Elizabeth
a letter or memorandum of personal recollections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
of Margaret and her ideas. Can't you
ask her to write it for me?</p>

<p class="author">
H. G."<br />
</p></div>

<p>To the request of this postscript Thoreau
attended at once, but the "Miscellanies"
dwelt not in his mind, it would seem. He
had now become deeply concerned about
slavery, was also pursuing his studies concerning
the Indians, and had little time for
the collection of his published papers. A
short note of April 2, 1854, closes this part
of the Greeley correspondence, thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Thoreau</span>,&mdash;Thank you for your
kindness in the matter of Margaret. Pray take
no further trouble; but if anything should come
in your way, calculated to help me, do not forget.</p>

<p class="salusig">
"Yours,</p>

<p class="author">"<span class="smcap">Horace Greeley</span>."<br />
</p></div>

<p>In August, 1855, Mr. Greeley wrote to
suggest that copies of "Walden" should be
sent to the "Westminster Review," to "The
Reasoner," 147 Fleet Street, London, to
Gerald Massey, office of the "News," Edinburgh,
and to "&mdash;&mdash; Wills, Esq., Dickens's
Household Words," adding:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There is a small class in England who ought
to know what you have written, and I feel sure
your publishers would not throw away copies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
sent to these periodicals; especially if your
'Week on the Concord and Merrimac' could
accompany them. Chapman, editor of the 'Westminster,'
expressed surprise that your book had
not been sent him, and I could find very few who
had read or seen it. If a new edition should be
called for, try to have it better known in Europe,
but have a few copies sent to those worthy of it,
at all events."</p></div>

<p>In March, 1856, Mr. Greeley opened a
new correspondence with Thoreau, asking
him to become the tutor of his children, and
to live with him, or near him, at Chappaqua.
The proposition was made in the
most generous manner, and was for a time
considered by Thoreau, who felt a sense of
obligation as well as a sincere friendship towards
the man who had believed in him
and served him so seasonably in the years
of his obscurity. But it resulted in nothing
further than a brief visit to Mr. Greeley
in the following autumn, during which, as
Thoreau used to say, Mr. Alcott and Mr.
Greeley went to the opera together.</p>

IN WOOD AND FIELD.</h2>


<p>Except the Indians themselves, whose
wood-craft he never tires of celebrating, few
Americans were ever more at home in the
open air than Thoreau; not even his friend
John Brown, who, like himself, suggested
the Indian by the delicacy of his perceptions
and his familiarity with all that goes
forward, or stands still, in wood and field.
Thoreau could find his path in the woods
at night, he said, better by his feet than
his eyes.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"He was a good swimmer," says Emerson, "a
good runner, skater, boatman, and would outwalk
most countrymen in a day's journey. And
the relation of body to mind was still finer. The
length of his walk uniformly made the length of
his writing. If shut up in the house, he did not
write at all."</p></div>

<p>In his last illness says Channing,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>"His habit of engrossing his thoughts in a
journal, which had lasted for a quarter of a century,&mdash;his
out-door life, of which he used to say,
if he omitted that, all his living ceased,&mdash;this
now became so incontrovertibly a thing of the
past that he said once, standing at the window,
'I cannot see on the outside at all. We thought
ourselves great philosophers in those wet days
when we used to go out and sit down by the
wall-sides.' This was absolutely all he was ever
heard to say of that outward world during his
illness, neither could a stranger in the least infer
that he had ever a friend in field or wood."</p></div>

<p>This out-door life began as early as he
could recollect, and his special attraction to
rivers, woods, and lakes was a thing of his
boyhood. He had begun to collect Indian
relics before leaving college, and was a
diligent student of natural history there.
Whether he was naturally an observer or
not (which has been denied in a kind of
malicious paradox), let his life-work attest.
Early in 1847 he made some collections of
fishes, turtles, etc., in Concord for Agassiz,
then newly arrived in America, and I have
(in a letter of May 3, 1847) this account of
their reception:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>"I carried them immediately to Mr. Agassiz,
who was highly delighted with them. Some of
the species he had seen before, but never in so
fresh condition. Others, as the breams and the
pout, he had seen only in spirits, and the little
turtle he knew only from the books. I am sure
you would have felt fully repaid for your trouble,
if you could have seen the eager satisfaction with
which he surveyed each fin and scale. He said
the small mud-turtle was really a very rare species,
quite distinct from the snapping-turtle. The
breams and pout seemed to please the Professor
very much. He would gladly come up to Concord
to make a spearing excursion, as you suggested,
but is drawn off by numerous and pressing
engagements."</p></div>

<p>On the 27th of May, Thoreau's correspondent
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Mr. Agassiz was very much surprised and
pleased at the extent of the collections you sent
during his absence; the little fox he has established
in comfortable quarters in his backyard,
where he is doing well. Among the fishes
you sent there is one, probably two, new species."</p></div>

<p>June 1st, in other collections, other new
species were discovered, much to Agassiz's
delight, who never failed afterward to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> cultivate
Thoreau's society when he could.
But the poet avoided the man of science,
having no love for dissection; though he
recognized in Agassiz the qualities that
gave him so much distinction.</p>

<p>The paper on "Ktaadn and the Maine
Woods," which Horace Greeley bought "at
a Jew's bargain," and sold to a publisher
for seventy-five dollars, was the journal of
a visit made to the highest mountain of
Maine during Thoreau's second summer at
Walden. An aunt of his had married in
Bangor, Maine, and her daughters had again
married there, so that the young forester
of Concord had kinsmen on the Penobscot,
engaged in converting the Maine forests
into pine lumber. At the end of August,
in 1846, while his Carlyle manuscript was
passing from Greeley to Griswold, from
Griswold to Graham, and from Graham to
the Philadelphia type-setters, Thoreau himself
was on his way from Boston to Bangor;
and on the first day of September he started
with his cousin from Bangor, to explore the
upper waters of the Penobscot and climb
the summit of Ktaadn. The forest region
about this mountain had been explored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
in 1837 by Dr. Jackson, the State Geologist,
a brother-in-law of Mr. Emerson; but no
poet before Thoreau had visited these solitudes
and described his experiences there.
James Russell Lowell did so a few years
later, and, early in the century, Hawthorne,
Longfellow, and Emerson had tested the
solitude of the Maine woods, and written
about them. The verses of Emerson, describing
his own experiences there (not so
well known as they should be), are often
thought to imply Thoreau, though they
were written before Emerson had known
his younger friend, whose after adventures
they portray with felicity.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In unploughed Maine he sought the lumberers' gang,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The all-seeing sun for ages hath not shone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where feeds the moose and walks the surly bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And up the tall mast runs the woodpecker.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw beneath dim aisles, in odorous beds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slight Linnæa hang its twin-born heads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blessed the monument of the man of flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which breathes his sweet fame through the northern bowers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He heard, when in the grove, at intervals<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sudden roar the aged pine-tree falls,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One crash, the death-hymn of the perfect tree,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Through these green tents, by eldest Nature dressed,<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>Thus much is a picture of the Maine
forests, and may have been suggested in
part by the woodland life of Dr. Jackson
there while surveying the State. But what
follows is the brave proclamation of the
poet, for himself and his heroes, among
whom Thoreau and John Brown must be
counted, since it declares their creed and
practice,&mdash;while in the last couplet the
whole inner doctrine of Transcendentalism
is set forth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The timid it concerns to ask their way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fear what foes in caves and swamps can stray,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And ills to come as evils past bemoan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not so the wise: no timid watch he keeps<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>Thoreau may have heard these verses
read by their author in his study, before he
set forth on his first journey to Maine in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
1838; they were first published in the
"Dial" in October, 1840, but are omitted,
for some reason, in a partial edition of Emerson's
Poems (in 1876). He never complied
with this description so far as to spend
three months in the Maine woods, even in
the three campaigns which he made there
(in 1846, in 1853, and in 1857), for in
none of these did he occupy three weeks,
and in all but little more than a month.
His account of them, as now published,
makes a volume by itself, which his friend
Channing edited two years after Thoreau's
death, and which contains the fullest record
of his studies of the American Indian. It
was his purpose to develop these studies
into a book concerning the Indian, and
for this purpose he made endless readings
in the Jesuit Fathers, in books of
travel, and in all the available literature of
the subject. But the papers he had thus
collected were not left in such form that
they could be published; and so much of his
untiring diligence seems now lost, almost
thrown away. Doubtless his friends and
editors, upon call, will one day print detached
portions of these studies, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> entries
in his journals, and from his commonplace
books.</p>

<p>In his explorations of Concord and its
vicinity, as well as in those longer foot-journeys
which he took among the mountains
and along the sea-shore of New England,
from 1838 to 1860, Thoreau's habits
were those of an experienced hunter, though
he seldom used a gun in his years of manhood.
Upon this point he says in "Walden":&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Almost every New England boy among my
contemporaries shouldered a fowling-piece between
the ages of ten and fourteen; and his
hunting and fishing grounds were not limited,
like the preserves of an English nobleman, but
were more boundless than even those of the savage.
Perhaps I have owed to fishing and hunting,
when quite young, my closest acquaintance
with Nature. They early introduce us to and
detain us in scenery with which, otherwise, at
that age, we should have little acquaintance.
Fishermen, hunters, wood-choppers, and others,
spending their lives in the fields and woods, in a
peculiar sense a part of Nature themselves, are
often in a more favorable mood for observing
her, in the intervals of their pursuits, than philosophers
or poets, even, who approach her with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
expectation. She is not afraid to exhibit herself
to them.... I have actually fished from the
same kind of necessity that the first fishers did.
I have long felt differently about fowling, and
sold my gun before I went to the woods. I did
not pity the fishes nor the worms. As for fowling,
during the last years that I carried a gun my
excuse was that I was studying ornithology, and
sought only new or rare birds. But I am now
inclined to think there is a finer way of studying
ornithology than this. It requires so much
closer attention to the habits of the birds that, if
for that reason only, I have been willing to omit
the gun.... We cannot but pity the boy
who has never fired a gun; he is no more humane,
while his education has been sadly neglected."</p></div>

<p>Emerson mentions that Thoreau preferred
his spy-glass to his gun to bring the bird
nearer to his eye, and says also of his patience
in out-door observation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"He knew how to sit immovable, a part of the
rock he rested on, until the bird, the reptile, the
fish, which had retired from him, should come
back and resume its habits,&mdash;nay, moved by
curiosity, should come to him and watch him."</p></div>

<p>And I have thought that Emerson had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
Thoreau in mind when he described his
"Forester":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He took the color of his vest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From rabbit's coat or grouse's breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For as the wood-kinds lurk and hide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So walks the woodman unespied."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The same friend said of him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It was a pleasure and a privilege to walk
with him. He knew the country like a fox or
bird, and passed through it as freely by paths of
his own. Under his arm he carried an old music-book
to press plants;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> in his pocket his diary
and pencil, a spy-glass for birds, microscope,
jack-knife, and twine. He wore straw hat, stout
shoes, strong gray trousers, to brave shrub-oaks
and smilax, and to climb a tree for a hawk's
or squirrel's nest. He waded into the pool for
the water-plants, and his strong legs were no
insignificant part of his armor. His intimacy
with animals suggested what Thomas Fuller records
of Butler the apiologist, 'that either he had
told the bees things, or the bees had told him.'
Snakes coiled round his leg, the fishes swam into
his hand, and he took them out of the water; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
pulled the woodchuck out of its hole by the tail,
and took the foxes under his protection from the
hunters. He confessed that he sometimes felt
like a hound or a panther, and, if born among
Indians, would have been a fell hunter. But,
restrained by his Massachusetts culture, he played
out the game in the mild form of botany and
ichthyology. His power of observation seemed
to indicate additional senses; he saw as with
microscope, heard as with ear-trumpet, and his
memory was a photographic register of all he
saw and heard. Every fact lay in order and
glory in his mind, a type of the order and beauty
of the whole."</p></div>

<p>It was this poetic and coördinating vision
of the natural world which distinguished
Thoreau from the swarm of naturalists, and
raised him to the rank of a philosopher
even in his tedious daily observations.
Channing, no less than Emerson, has observed
and noted this trait, giving to his
friend the exact title of "poet-naturalist,"
and also, in his poem, "The Wanderer,"
bestowing on him the queer name of <em>Idolon</em>,
which he thus explains:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"So strangely was the general current mixed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his vexed native blood in its crank wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That as a mirror shone the common world<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To this observing youth,&mdash;whom noting, thence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I called <em>Idolon</em>,&mdash;ever firm to mark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swiftly reflected in himself the Whole."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In an earlier poem Channing had called
him "Rudolpho," and had thus portrayed
his daily and nightly habits of observation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I see Rudolpho cross our honest fields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Collapsed with thought, and as the Stagyrite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At intellectual problems, mastering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Day after day part of the world's concern.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor welcome dawns nor shrinking nights him menace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still adding to his list beetle and bee,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of what the vireo builds a pensile nest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And why the peetweet drops her giant egg<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In wheezing meadows, odorous with sweet brake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who wonders that the flesh declines to grow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along his sallow pits? or that his life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To social pleasure careless, pines away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In dry seclusion and unfruitful shade?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must admire thy brave apprenticeship<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To those dry forages, although the worldling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laugh in his sleeve at thy compelled devotion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shalt thou learn, Rudolpho, as thou walk'st,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More from the winding lanes where Nature leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her unaspiring creatures, and surpass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In some fine saunter her acclivity."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The hint here given that Thoreau injured
his once robust health by his habits of out-door
study and the hardships he imposed
on himself, had too much truth in it. Growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
up with great strength of body and
limb, and having cultivated his physical advantages
by a temperate youth much exercised
with manual labor, in which he took
pleasure, Thoreau could not learn the lesson
of moderation in those pursuits to which
his nature inclined. He exposed himself
in his journeys and night encampments to
cold and hunger, and changes of weather,
which the strongest cannot brave with impunity.
Mr. Edward Hoar, who traveled
with him in the Maine woods in 1857,&mdash;a
journey of three hundred and twenty-five
miles with a canoe and an Indian, among
the head-waters of the Kennebec, Penobscot,
and St. John's rivers,&mdash;and who in
1858 visited the White Mountains with
him, remembers, with a shiver to this day,
the rigor of a night spent on the bare rocks
of Mount Washington, with insufficient
blankets,&mdash;Thoreau sleeping from habit,
but himself lying wakeful all night, and
gazing at the coldest of full moons. It was
after such an experience as this on Monadnoc,
whither Thoreau and Channing went
to camp out for a week in August, 1860,
that the latter wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i22">"With the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reserved companion, cool and sparsely clad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dream, till the threefold hour with lowly voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steals whispering in thy frame, 'Rise, valiant youth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dawn draws on apace, envious of thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And polar in his gait; advance thy limbs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor strive to heat the stones.'"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Thoreau had much scorn for weakness
like this, and said of his comrade, "I fear
that he did not improve all the night as he
might have done, to sleep." This was his
last excursion, and he died within less than
two years afterward. The account of it
which Channing has given may therefore
be read with interest:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"He ascended such hills as Monadnoc by his
own path; would lay down his map on the summit
and draw a line to the point he proposed to
visit below,&mdash;perhaps forty miles away on the
landscape, and set off bravely to make the 'shortcut.'
The lowland people wondered to see him
scaling the heights as if he had lost his way, or
at his jumping over their cow-yard fences,&mdash;asking
if he had fallen from the clouds. In a
walk like this he always carried his umbrella;
and on this Monadnoc trip, when about a mile
from the station (in Troy, N. H.), a torrent of
rain came down; without the umbrella his books,
blankets, maps, and provisions would all have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
been spoiled, or the morning lost by delay. On
the mountain there being a thick soaking fog,
the first object was to camp and make tea.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> He
spent five nights in camp, having built another
hut, to get varied views. Flowers, birds, lichens,
and the rocks were carefully examined, all parts
of the mountain were visited, and as accurate a
map as could be made by pocket compass was
carefully sketched and drawn out, in the five
days spent there,&mdash;with notes of the striking
aerial phenomena, incidents of travel and natural
history. The fatigue, the blazing sun, the face
getting broiled, the pint-cup never scoured, shaving
unutterable, your stockings dreary, having
taken to peat,&mdash;not all the books in the world,
as Sancho says, could contain the adventures of
a week in camping. The wild, free life, the open
air, the new and strange sounds by night and
day, the odd and bewildering rocks, amid which
a person can be lost within a rod of camp; the
strange cries of visitors to the summit; the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
valley over to Wachusett, with its thunder-storms
and battles in the cloud; the farmers' backyards
in Jaffrey, where the family cotton can be
seen bleaching on the grass, but no trace of the
pigmy family; the dry, soft air all night, the
lack of dew in the morning; the want of water,&mdash;a
pint being a good deal,&mdash;these, and similar
things make up some part of such an excursion."</p></div>

<p>These excursions were common with
Thoreau, but less so with Channing, who
therefore, notes down many things that his
friend would not think worth recording, except
as a part of that calendar of Nature
which he set himself to keep, and of which
his journals, for more than twenty years,
are the record. From these he made up
his printed volumes, and there may be read
the details that he registered. He had
gauges for the height of the river, noted
the temperature of springs and ponds, the
tints of the morning and evening sky, the
flowering and fruit of plants, all the habits
of birds and animals, and every aspect of
nature from the smallest to the greatest.
Much of this is the dryest detail, but everywhere
you come upon strokes of beauty, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
a single word-picture, or in a page of idyllic
description, like this of the Concord
heifer, which might be a poem of Theocritus,
or one of the lost bucolics of Moschus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"One more confiding heifer, the fairest of the
herd, did by degrees approach, as if to take some
morsel from our hands, while our hearts leaped
to our mouths with expectation and delight. She
by degrees drew near with her fair limbs progressive,
making pretense of browsing; nearer
and nearer till there was wafted to us the bovine
fragrance,&mdash;cream of all the dairies that
ever were or will be,&mdash;and then she raised her
gentle muzzle toward us, and snuffed an honest
recognition within hand's reach. I saw it was
possible for his herd to inspire with love the
herdsman. She was as delicately featured as
a hind; her hide was mingled white and fawn
color; on her muzzle's tip there was a white
spot not bigger than a daisy; and on her side
turned toward me the map of Asia plain to see.
Farewell, dear heifer! though thou forgettest
me, my prayer to heaven shall be that thou
may'st not forget thyself.</p>

<p>"I saw her name was Sumach. And by the
kindred spots I knew her mother, more sedate
and matronly, with full-grown bag, and on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
sides was Asia, great and small, the plains of
Tartary, even to the pole, while on her daughter's
was Asia Minor. She was not disposed to wanton
with the herdsman. As I walked the heifer
followed me, and took an apple from my hand,
and seemed to care more for the hand than the
apple. So innocent a face I have rarely seen on
any creature, and I have looked in the face of
many heifers; and as she took the apple from
my hand, I caught the apple of her eye. There
was no sinister expression. She smelled as sweet
as the clethra blossom. For horns, though she
had them, they were so well disposed in the right
place, but neither up nor down, that I do not
now remember she had any."</p></div>

<p>Or take this apostrophe to the "Queen
of Night, the Huntress Diana," which is not
a translation from some Greek worshipper,
but the sincere ascription of a New England
hunter of the noblest deer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"My dear, my dewy sister, let thy rain descend
on me! I not only love thee, but I love
the best of thee,&mdash;that is to love thee rarely.
I do not love thee every day&mdash;commonly I love
those who are less than thee; I love thee only
on great days. Thy dewy words feed me like the
manna of the morning. I am as much thy sister
as thy brother; thou art as much my brother as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
my sister. It is a portion of thee and a portion
of me which are of kin. O my sister! O Diana!
thy tracks are on the eastern hill; thou newly
didst pass that way. I, the hunter, saw them in
the morning dew. My eyes are the hounds that
pursued thee. I hear thee; thou canst speak, I
cannot; I fear and forget to answer; I am occupied
with hearing. I awoke and thought of
thee; thou wast present to my mind. How
camest thou there? Was I not present to thee,
likewise?"</p></div>

<p>In such a lofty mystical strain did this
Concord Endymion declare his passion for
Nature, in whose green lap he slumbers now
on the hill-side which the goddess nightly
revisits.</p>

PERSONAL TRAITS AND SOCIAL LIFE.</h2>


<p>The face of Thoreau, once seen, could
not easily be forgotten, so strong was the
mark that genius had set upon it. The
portrait of him, which has been commonly
engraved, though it bore some resemblance
at the time it was taken (by S. W. Rowse,
in 1854), was never a very exact likeness.
A few years later he began to wear his
beard long, and this fine silken muffler for
his delicate throat and lungs, was also an
ornament to his grave and thoughtful face,
concealing its weakest feature, a receding
chin. The head engraved for this volume is
from a photograph taken, in 1861, at New
Bedford, and shows him as he was in his
last years. His personal traits were not startling
and commanding like those of Webster,
who drew the eyes of all men wherever he
appeared, but they were peculiar, and dwelt
long in the memory. His features were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
prominent, his eyes large, round, and deep-set,
under bold brows, and full of fearless
meditation; the color varying from blue to
gray, as if with the moods of his mind. A
youth who saw him for the first time, said
with a start, "How deep and clear is the
mark that <em>thought</em> sets upon a man's face!"
And, indeed, no man could fail to recognize
in him that rare intangible essence we call
<em>thought</em>; his slight figure was active with
it, while in his face it became contemplative,
as if, like his own peasant, he were
"meditating some vast and sunny problem."
Channing says of his appearance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In height he was about the average; in his
build spare, with limbs that were rather longer
than usual, or of which he made a longer use.
His features were marked; the nose aquiline or
very Roman, like one of the portraits of Cæsar
(more like a beak, as was said); large overhanging
brows above the deepest-set blue eyes that
could be seen,&mdash;blue in certain lights and in
others gray; the forehead not unusually broad or
high, full of concentrated energy and purpose;
the mouth with prominent lips, pursed up with
meaning and thought when silent, and giving out
when open a stream of the most varied and unusual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
and instructive sayings. His whole figure
had an active earnestness, as if he had no moment
to waste; the clenched hand betokened
purpose. In walking he made a short cut, if he
could, and when sitting in the shade or by the
wall-side, seemed merely the clearer to look forward
into the next piece of activity. The intensity
of his mind, like Dante's, conveyed the
breathing of aloofness,&mdash;his eyes bent on the
ground, his long swinging gait, his hands perhaps
clasped behind him, or held closely at his side,&mdash;the
fingers made into a fist."</p></div>

<p>It is not possible to describe him more
exactly.</p>

<p>In December, 1854, Thoreau went to
lecture at Nantucket, and on his way spent
a day or two with one of his correspondents,
Daniel Ricketson of New Bedford,&mdash;reaching
his house on Christmas day. His
host, who then saw him for the first time,
thus recorded his impressions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I had expected him at noon, but as he did
not arrive, I had given him up for the day. In
the latter part of the afternoon, I was clearing
off the snow, which had fallen during the day,
from my front steps, when, looking up, I saw a
man walking up the carriage-road, bearing a portmanteau
in one hand and an umbrella in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
other. He was dressed in a long overcoat of
dark color, and wore a dark soft hat. I had no
suspicion it was Thoreau, and rather supposed it
was a pedler of small wares."</p></div>

<p>This was a common mistake to make
about Thoreau. When he ran the gauntlet
of the Cape Cod villages,&mdash;"feeling as
strange," he says, "as if he were in a town
in China,"&mdash;one of the old fishermen could
not believe that he had not something
to sell, as Bronson Alcott had when he
perambulated Eastern Virginia and North
Carolina in 1819-22, peddling silks and
jewelry. Being assured that Thoreau was
not peddling spectacles or books, the fisherman
said at last: "Well, it makes no odds
what it is you carry, so long as you carry
Truth along with you."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"As Thoreau came near me," continues Mr.
Ricketson, "he stopped and said, 'You do not
know me.' It flashed at once on my mind that
the person before me was my correspondent,
whom in my imagination I had figured as stout
and robust, instead of the small and rather inferior-looking
man before me. I concealed my
disappointment, and at once replied, 'I presume
this is Mr. Thoreau.' Taking his portmanteau,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
I conducted him to his room, already awaiting
him. My disappointment at his personal appearance
passed off on hearing his conversation
at the table and during the evening; and rarely
through the years of my acquaintance with him
did his presence conflict with his noble powers of
mind, his rich conversation, and broad erudition.
His face was afterwards greatly improved in
manly expression by the growth of his beard,
which he wore in full during the later years of
his life; but when I first saw him he had just
been sitting for the crayon portrait of 1854,
which represents him without the beard. The
'ambrotype' of him, which is engraved for your
volume, was taken for me by Dunshee, at New
Bedford, August 21, 1861, on his last visit to me
at Brooklawn. His health was then failing,&mdash;he
had a racking cough,&mdash;but his face, except a
shade of sadness in the eyes, did not show it.
Of this portrait, Miss Sophia Thoreau, to whom
I sent it soon after her brother's death, wrote me,
May 26, 1862: 'I cannot tell you how agreeably
surprised I was, on opening the little box,
to find my own lost brother again. I could not
restrain my tears. The picture is invaluable to
us. I discover a slight shade about the eyes, expressive
of weariness; but a stranger might not
observe it. I am very glad to possess a picture
of so late a date. The crayon, drawn eight years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
ago next summer, we considered good; it betrays
the poet. Mr. Channing, Mr. Emerson,
Mr. Alcott, and many other friends who have
looked at the ambrotype, express much satisfaction.'"</p></div>

<p>Of Thoreau's appearance then (at the
age of thirty-seven), Mr. Ricketson goes on
to say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The most expressive feature of his face was
his eye, blue in color, and full of the greatest humanity
and intelligence. His head was of medium
size, the same as that of Emerson, and he
wore a number seven hat. His arms were
rather long, his legs short, and his hands and
feet rather large. His sloping shoulders were a
mark of observation. But when in usual health
he was strong and vigorous, a remarkable pedestrian,
tiring out nearly all his companions in
his prolonged tramps through woods and marshes,
when in pursuit of some rare plant. In Thoreau,
as in Dr. Kane, Lord Nelson, and other
heroic men, it was the spirit more than the temple
in which it dwelt, that made the man."</p></div>

<p>A strange mistake has prevailed as to the
supposed churlishness and cynical severity
of Thoreau, which Mr. Alcott, in one of
his octogenarian sonnets, has corrected, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
which all who knew the man would protest
against.</p>

<p>Of his domestic character Mr. Ricketson
writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Some have accused him of being an imitator
of Emerson, others as unsocial, impracticable, and
ascetic. Now, he was none of these. A more
original man never lived, nor one more thoroughly
a personification of civility. Having been
an occasional guest at his house, I can assert that
no man could hold a finer relationship with his
family than he."</p></div>

<p>Channing says the same thing more
quaintly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In his own home he was one of those characters
who may be called household treasures; always
on the spot with skillful eye and hand, to
raise the best melons, plant the orchard with the
choicest trees, and act as extempore mechanic;
fond of the pets,&mdash;his sister's flowers or sacred
tabby&mdash;kittens being his favorites,&mdash;he would
play with them by the half hour."</p></div>

<p>He was sometimes given to music and
song, and now and then, in moments of
great hilarity, would dance gayly,&mdash;as he
did once at Brooklawn, in the presence of
his host, Mr. Ricketson, and Mr. Alcott,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
who was also visiting there. On the same
occasion he sung his unique song of "Tom
Bowline," which none who heard would
ever forget, and finished the evening with
his dance.</p>

<p>Hearing Mr. Ricketson speak of this
dance, Miss Thoreau said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have so often witnessed the like, that I can
easily imagine how it was; and I remember that
Henry gave me some account of it. I recollect
he said he did not scruple to tread on Mr. Alcott's
toes."</p></div>

<p>Mr. Ricketson's own account is this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"One afternoon, when my wife was playing
an air upon the piano,&mdash;'Highland Laddie,'
perhaps,&mdash;Thoreau became very hilarious, sang
'Tom Bowline,' and finally entered upon an
improvised dance. Not being able to stand what
appeared to me at the time the somewhat ludicrous
appearance of our Walden hermit, I retreated
to my 'shanty,' a short distance from my
house; while my older and more humor-loving
friend Alcott remained and saw it through, much
to his amusement. It left a pleasant memory,
which I recorded in some humble lines that afterwards
appeared in my 'Autumn Sheaf.'"</p></div>

<p>After Thoreau's return home from this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
visit, his New Bedford friend seems to have
sent him a copy of the words and music of
"Tom Bowline," which was duly acknowledged
and handed over to the musical people
of Concord for them to play and sing.
It is a fine old pathetic sailor-song of Dibdin's,
which pleased Thoreau (whose imagination
delighted in the sea), and perhaps
reminded him of his brother John. As
Thoreau sang it, the verses ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here a sheer hulk lies poor Tom Bowline,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The darling of our crew;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">For death has broached him to.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His form was of the manliest beauty;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His heart was kind and soft;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And then he'd sing so blithe and jolly;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ah, many's the time and oft!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But mirth is changed to melancholy,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For Tom is gone aloft.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yet shall poor Tom find pleasant weather<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The word to pipe all hands.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Thus death, who kings and tars dispatches,<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>Another of his songs was Moore's "Canadian
Boat Song," with its chorus,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"Row brothers, row."<br />
</p>

<p>Mrs. W. H. Forbes, who knew him in her
childhood, from the age of six to that of fifteen
more particularly, and who first remembers
him in his hut at Walden, writes me:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The time when Mr. Thoreau was our more
intimate playfellow must have been in the years
from 1850 to 1855. He used to come in, at
dusk, as my brother and I sat on the rug before
the dining-room fire, and, taking the great green
rocking-chair, he would tell us stories. Those I
remember were his own adventures, as a child.
He began with telling us of the different houses
he had lived in, and what he could remember
about each. The house where he was born was
on the Virginia road, near the old Bedford road.
The only thing he remembered about that house
was that from its windows he saw a flock of geese
walking along in a row on the other side of the
road; but to show what a long memory he had,
when he told his mother of this, she said the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
time he could have seen that sight was, when he
was about eight months old, for they left that
house then. Soon after, he lived in the old house
on the Lexington road, nearly opposite Mr. Emerson's.
There he was tossed by a cow as he
played near the door, in his red flannel dress,&mdash;and
so on, with a story for every house. He used
to delight us with the adventures of a brood of fall
chickens, which slept at night in a tall old fashioned
fig-drum in the kitchen, and as their bed
was not changed when they grew larger, they
packed themselves every night each in its own
place, and grew up, not shapely, but shaped to
each other and the drum, like figs!</p>

<p>"Sometimes he would play juggler tricks for
us, and swallow his knife and produce it again
from our ears or noses. We usually ran to bring
some apples for him as soon as he came in, and
often he would cut one in halves in fine points
that scarcely showed on close examination, and
then the joke was to ask Father to break it for
us and see it fall to pieces in his hands. But
perhaps the evenings most charming were those
when he brought some ears of pop-corn in his
pocket and headed an expedition to the garret to
hunt out the old brass warming-pan; in which he
would put the corn, and hold it out and shake it
over the fire till it was heated through, and at
last, as we listened, the rattling changed to popping.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
When this became very brisk, he would
hold the pan over the rug and lift the lid, and a
beautiful fountain of the white corn flew all over
us. It required both strength and patience to hold
out the heavy warming-pan at arm's length so
long, and no one else ever gave us that pleasure.</p>

<p>"I remember his singing 'Tom Bowline' to us,
and also playing on his flute, but that was earlier.
In the summer he used to make willow whistles,
and trumpets out of the stems of squash leaves, and
onion leaves. When he found fine berries during
his walks, he always remembered us, and
came to arrange a huckleberrying for us. He
took charge of the 'hay rigging' with the load of
children, who sat on the floor which was spread
with hay, covered with a buffalo-robe; he sat
on a board placed across the front and drove,
and led the frolic with his jokes and laughter as
we jolted along, while the elders of the family
accompanied us in a 'carryall.' Either he had
great tact and skill in managing us and keeping
our spirits and play within bounds, or else he became
a child in sympathy with us, for I do not
remember a check or reproof from him, no matter
how noisy we were. He always was most
kind to me and made it his especial care to establish
me in the 'thickest places,' as we used to
call them. Those sunny afternoons are bright
memories, and the lamb-kill flowers and sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
'everlasting,' always recall them and his kind
care. Once in awhile he took us on the river
in his boat, a rare pleasure then; and I remember
one brilliant autumn afternoon, when he took
us to gather the wild grapes overhanging the
river, and we brought home a load of crimson
and golden boughs as well. He never took us
to walk with him, but sometimes joined us for a
little way, if he met us in the woods on Sunday
afternoons. He made those few steps memorable
by showing us many wonders in so short a space:
perhaps the only chincapin oak in Concord, so
hidden that no one but himself could have discovered
it&mdash;or some remarkable bird, or nest, or
flower. He took great interest in my garden of
wild flowers, and used to bring me seeds, or
roots, of rare plants. In his last illness it did
not occur to us that he would care to see us, but
his sister told my mother that he watched us
from the window as we passed, and said: 'Why
don't they come to see me? I love them as if
they were my own.' After that we went often,
and he always made us so welcome that we liked
to go. I remember our last meetings with as
much pleasure as the old play-days."</p></div>

<p>Although so great a traveler in a small
circle&mdash;being every day a-field when not
too ill,&mdash;he was also a great stay-at-home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
He never crossed the ocean, nor saw Niagara
or the Mississippi until the year before his
death. He lived within twenty miles of Boston,
but seldom went there, except to pass
through it on his way to the Maine woods,
to Cape Cod, to the house of his friend,
Marston Watson at Plymouth, or to Daniel
Ricketson's at New Bedford. To the latter
he wrote in February, 1855:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I did not go to Boston, for, with regard to
that place I sympathize with one of my neighbors
(George Minott), an old man, who has not
been there since the last war, when he was compelled
to go. No, I have a real genius for staying
at home."</p></div>

<p>What took him from home in the winter
season was generally some engagement to
lecture, of which he had many after his
Walden life became a little known abroad.</p>

<p>From the year 1847 Thoreau may be
said to have fairly entered on his career as
author and lecturer; having taken all the
needful degrees and endured most of the
mortifications necessary for the public profession
of authorship. Up to that time he
had supported himself, except while in college,
chiefly by the labor of his hands;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
after 1847, though still devoted to manual
labor occasionally, he yet worked chiefly
with his head as thinker, observer, surveyor,
magazine contributor, and lecturer.</p>

<p>His friends were the first promoters of
his lectures, and among his correspondence
are some letters from Hawthorne, inviting
him to the Salem Lyceum. The first of
these letters is dated, Salem, October 21,
1848, and runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The managers of the Salem
Lyceum, sometime ago, voted that you
should be requested to deliver a lecture before
that Institution during the approaching season.
I know not whether Mr. Chever, the late corresponding
secretary, communicated the vote to
you; at all events, no answer has been received,
and as Mr. Chever's successor in office, I am requested
to repeat the invitation. Permit me to
add my own earnest wishes that you will accept
it; and also, laying aside my official dignity, to
express my wife's desire and my own that you
will be our guest, if you do come. In case of
your compliance, the Managers desire to know
at what time it will best suit you to deliver the
lecture.</p>

<p class="salusig">
"Very truly yours,</p>

<p class="author">"<span class="smcap">Nath<sup>l</sup> Hawthorne</span>,<br />
"<em>Cor. Sec'y, Salem Lyceum</em>.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>"P.S. I live at No. 14 Mall Street, where I
shall be very happy to see you. The stated fee
for lectures is $20."</p></div>

<p>A month later, Hawthorne, who had received
an affirmative answer from Thoreau,
wrote to him from Boston (November 20,
1848), as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Thoreau</span>,&mdash;I did not sooner
write you, because there were preëngagements for
the two or three first lectures, so that I could
not arrange matters to have you come during the
present month. But, as it happens, the expected
lectures have failed us, and we now depend on
you to come the very next Wednesday. I shall
announce you in the paper of to-morrow, so you
<em>must</em> come. I regret that I could not give you
longer notice. We shall expect you on Wednesday
at No. 14 Mall Street.</p>

<p class="salusig">
"Yours truly,</p>
<p class="author">"<span class="smcap">Nath<sup>l</sup> Hawthorne</span>.<br />
</p>

<p>"If it be utterly impossible for you to come,
pray write me a line so that I may get it Wednesday
evening. But by all means come.</p>

<p>"This secretaryship is an intolerable bore. I
have traveled thirty miles, this wet day, on no
other business."</p></div>

<p>Apparently another lecture was wanted
by the Salem people the same winter, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
on the 19th of February, 1849, when the
"Week on the Concord and Merrimac"
was in press, Hawthorne wrote again,
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The managers request that you will lecture
before the Salem Lyceum on Wednesday evening
<em>after</em> next, that is to say, on the 28th inst.
May we depend on you? Please to answer immediately,
if convenient. Mr. Alcott delighted
my wife and me, the other evening, by announcing
that you had a book in press. I rejoice at it,
and nothing doubt of such success as will be
worth having. Should your manuscripts all be
in the printer's hands, I suppose you can reclaim
one of them for a single evening's use, to be returned
the next morning,&mdash;or perhaps that Indian
lecture, which you mentioned to me, is in a
state of forwardness. Either that, or a continuation
of the Walden experiment (or indeed, anything
else), will be acceptable. We shall expect
you at 14 Mall Street.</p>

<p class="salusig">
"Very truly yours,</p>

<p class="author">"<span class="smcap">Nath<sup>l</sup> Hawthorne</span>."<br />
</p></div>

<p>These letters were written just before
Hawthorne was turned out of his office in
the Salem custom-house, and while his own
literary success was still in abeyance,&mdash;the
"Scarlet Letter" not being published till a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
year later. They show the friendly terms
on which Hawthorne stood with the Concord
Transcendentalists, after leaving that
town in 1846. He returned to it in 1852,
when he bought Mr. Alcott's estate, then
called "Hillside," which he afterward christened
"Wayside," and by this name it is
still known. Mr. Alcott bought this place
in 1845, and from then till 1848, when he
left it to reside in Boston, he expended, as
Hawthorne said, "a good deal of taste and
some money in forming the hill-side behind
the house into terraces, and building arbors
and summer-houses of rough stems, and
branches, and trees, on a system of his
own." In this work he was aided by Thoreau,
who was then in the habit of performing
much manual labor. In 1847 he joined
Mr. Alcott in the task of cutting trees for
Mr. Emerson's summer-house, which the
three friends were to build in the garden.
Mr. Emerson, however, went with them to
the woods but one day, when finding his
strength and skill unequal to that of his
companions, he withdrew, and left the work
to them. Mr. Alcott relates that Thoreau
was not only a master workman with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
axe, but also had such strength of arm, that
when a tree they were felling lodged in
some unlucky position, he rushed at it, and
by main strength carried out the trunk until
it fell where he wanted it.</p>

<p>It was one of the serious doctrines of the
Transcendentalists that each person should
perform his quota of hand-work, and accordingly
Alcott, Channing, Hawthorne,
and the rest, took their turn at wood-chopping,
hay-making, plowing, tree-pruning,
grafting, etc. Even Emerson trimmed
his own orchard, and sometimes lent a
hand in hoeing corn and raking hay. To
Thoreau such tasks were easy, and, unlike
some amateur farmers, he was quite
willing to be seen at his work, whatever it
might be (except the pencil-making, in
which there were certain secrets), and by
choice he wore plain working clothes, and
generally old ones. The fashion of his garments
gave him no concern, and was often
old, or even grotesque. At one time he
had a fancy for corduroy, such as Irish laborers
then wore, but which occasionally appeared
in the wardrobe of a gentleman. As
he climbed trees, waded swamps, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
out in all weathers during his daily excursions,
he naturally dressed himself for what
he had to do.</p>

<p>As may be inferred from his correspondence
with Horace Greeley, Thoreau's whole
income from authorship during the twenty
years that he practiced that profession, cannot
have exceeded a few hundred dollars
yearly,&mdash;not half enough in most years to
supply even his few wants. He would
never be indebted to any person pecuniarily,
and therefore he found out other ways
of earning his subsistence and paying his
obligations,&mdash;gardening, fence-building,
white-washing, pencil-making, land-surveying,
etc.,&mdash;for he had great mechanical
skill, and a patient, conscientious industry
in whatever he undertook. When his
father, who had been long living in other
men's houses, undertook, at last, to build
one of his own, Henry worked upon it, and
performed no small part of the manual labor.
He had no false pride in such matters,&mdash;was,
indeed, rather proud of his
workmanship, and averse to the gentility
even of his industrious village.</p>

<p>During his first residence at Mr. Emerson's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
in 1841-43, Thoreau managed the
garden and did other hand-work for his
friend; and when Mr. Emerson went to
England in 1847, he returned to the house
(soon after leaving his Walden hut), and
took charge of his friend's household affairs
in his absence. In a letter to his sister Sophia
(October 24, 1847), Thoreau says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"... I went to Boston the 5th of this month
to see Mr. Emerson off to Europe. He sailed in
the 'Washington Irving' packet ship, the same
in which Mr. Hedge went before him. Up to
this trip, the first mate aboard this ship was, as I
hear, one Stephens, a Concord boy, son of Stephens,
the carpenter, who used to live above Mr.
Dennis. Mr. Emerson's state-room was like a
carpeted dark closet, about six feet square, with
a large keyhole for a window (the window was
about as big as a saucer, and the glass two inches
thick), not to mention another skylight overhead
in the deck, of the size of an oblong doughnut,
and about as opaque. Of course, it would be in
vain to look up, if any contemplative promenader
put his foot upon it. Such will be his lodgings
for two or three weeks; and instead of a walk in
Walden woods, he will take a promenade on deck,
where the few trees, you know, are stripped of
their bark."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a poem of Thoreau's, of uncertain
date, called "The Departure," which,
as I suppose, expresses his emotions at leaving
finally, in 1848, the friendly house of
Emerson, where he had dwelt so long, upon
terms of such ideal intimacy. It was never
seen by his friends, so far as I can learn,
until after his death, when Sophia Thoreau
gave it to me, along with other poems, for
publication in the "Boston Commonwealth,"
in 1863. Since then it has been mentioned
as a poem written in anticipation of death.
This is not so; it was certainly written long
before his illness.</p>

POET, MORALIST, AND PHILOSOPHER.</h2>


<p>The character of poet is so high and so
rare, in any modern civilization, and specially
in our American career of nationality,
that it behooves us to mark and claim all
our true poets, before they are classified
under some other name,&mdash;as philosophers,
naturalists, romancers, or historians. Thus
Emerson is primarily and chiefly a poet,
and only a philosopher in his second intention;
and thus also Thoreau, though a naturalist
by habit, and a moralist by constitution,
was inwardly a poet by force of
that shaping and controlling imagination,
which was his strongest faculty. His mind
tended naturally to the ideal side. He
would have been an idealist in any circumstances;
a fluent and glowing poet, had he
been born among a people to whom poesy
is native, like the Greeks, the Italians, the
Irish. As it was, his poetic light illumined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
every wide prospect and every narrow
cranny in which his active, patient spirit
pursued its task. It was this inward illumination
as well as the star-like beam of
Emerson's genius in "Nature," which caused
Thoreau to write in his senior year at college,
"This curious world which we inhabit
is more wonderful than it is convenient;
more beautiful than it is useful," and he
cherished this belief through life. In youth,
too, he said, "The other world is all my
art, my pencils will draw no other, my jack-knife
will cut nothing else; I do not use it
as a means." It was in this spirit that he
afterwards uttered the quaint parable, which
was his version of the primitive legend of
the Golden Age:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I long ago lost a hound, a bay horse, and a
turtle-dove, and am still on their trail. Many
are the travelers I have spoken concerning them,
describing their tracks and what calls they answered
to. I have met one or two who had
heard the hound, and the tramp of the horse, and
even seen the dove disappear behind the cloud;
and they seemed as anxious to recover them as if
they had lost them themselves."</p></div>

<p>In the same significance read his little-known
verses, "The Pilgrims."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When I have slumbered<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I have heard sounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As of travelers passing<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'T was a sweet music<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Unless I dreamed it<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This was of yore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never told it<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Never remembered<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But in my dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What to me waking<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>It seems to have been the habit of Thoreau,
in writing verse, to compose a couplet,
a quatrain, or other short metrical expression,
copy it in his journal, and afterward,
when these verses had grown to a considerable
number, to arrange them in the form
of a single piece. This gives to his poems
the epigrammatic air which most of them
have. After he was thirty years old, he
wrote scarcely any verse, and he even destroyed
much that he had previously written,
following in this the judgment of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
Emerson, rather than his own, as he told
me one day during his last illness. He had
read all that was best in English and in
Greek poetry, but was more familiar with
the English poets of Milton's time and earlier,
than with those more recent, except
his own townsmen and companions. He
valued Milton above Shakespeare, and had
a special love for Æschylus, two of whose
tragedies he translated. He had read Pindar,
Simonides, and the Greek Anthology,
and wrote, at his best, as well as the finest
of the Greek lyric poets. Even Emerson,
who was a severe critic of his verses, says,
"His classic poem on 'Smoke' suggests
Simonides, but is better than any poem of
Simonides." Indeed, what Greek would
not be proud to claim this fragment as his
own?</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Light winged smoke, Icarian bird!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Melting thy pinions in thy upward flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lark without song, and messenger of dawn,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">. . . .<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go thou, my incense, upward from this hearth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ask the gods to pardon this clear flame."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>No complete collection of Thoreau's poems
has ever been made. Amid much that is
harsh and crude, such a book would contain
many verses sure to survive for centuries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>As a moralist, the bent of Thoreau is
more clearly seen by most readers; and on
this side, too, he was early and strongly
charged. In a college essay of 1837 are
these sentences:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Truth neither exalteth nor humbleth herself.
She is not too high for the low, nor yet too low
for the high. She is persuasive, not litigious,
leaving conscience to decide. She never sacrificeth
her dignity that she may secure for herself
a favorable reception. It is not a characteristic
of Truth to use men tenderly; nor is she overanxious
about appearances."</p></div>

<p>In another essay of the same year he
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The order of things should be reversed:
the seventh should be man's day of toil, in which
to earn his living by the sweat of his brow,
and the other six his Sabbath of the affections
and the soul, in which to range this wide-spread
garden, and drink in the soft influences and sublime
revelations of Nature."</p></div>

<p>This was an anticipation of his theory of
labor and leisure set forth in "Walden,"
where he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"For more than five years I maintained myself
solely by the labor of my hands, and I found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
that, by working about six weeks in a year, I
could meet all the expenses of living; the whole
of my winters, as well as most of my summers, I
had free and clear for study. I found that the
occupation of day-laborer was the most independent
of any, especially as it required only
thirty or forty days in the year to support one."</p></div>

<p>This was true of Thoreau, because, as he
said, his "greatest skill had been to want
but little." In him this economy was a
part of morality, or even of religion.</p>

<p>"The high moral impulse," says Channing,
"never deserted him, and he resolved
early to read no book, take no walk, undertake
no enterprise, but such as he could endure
to give an account of to himself." How
early this austerity appeared in what he
wrote, has been little noticed; but I discover
it in his earliest college essays, before
he was eighteen years old. Thus, in such
a paper of the year 1834, this passage occurs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There appears to be something noble, something
exalted, in giving up one's own interest for
that of his fellow-beings. He is a true patriot,
who, casting aside all selfish thoughts, and not suffering
his benevolent intentions to be polluted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
thinking of the fame he is acquiring, presses forward
in the great work he has undertaken, with
unremitted zeal; who is as one pursuing his way
through a garden abounding with fruits of every
description, without turning aside, or regarding
the brambles which impede his progress, but pressing
onward with his eyes fixed upon the golden
fruit before him. He is worthy of all praise; his
is, indeed, true greatness."</p></div>

<p>In contrast with this man the young
philosopher sets before us the man who
wishes, as the Greeks said,
&#960;&#955;&#949;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#957; [pleonektein],&mdash;to
get more than his square meal at the banquet of life.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Aristocrats may say what they please,&mdash;liberty
and equal rights are and ever will be grateful,
till nature herself shall change; and he who
is ambitious to exercise authority over his fellow-beings,
with no view to their benefit or injury,
is to be regarded as actuated by peculiarly selfish
motives. Self-gratification must be his sole object.
Perhaps he is desirous that his name may
be handed down to posterity; that in after ages
something more may be said of him than that he
lived and died. His deeds may never be forgotten;
but is this greatness? If so, may I pass
through life unheeded and unknown!"</p></div>

<p>What was his own ambition&mdash;a purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
in life which only the unthinking could ever
confound with selfishness&mdash;was expressed
by him early in a prayer which he threw
into this verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Great God! I ask Thee for no meaner pelf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than that I may not disappoint myself;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in my conduct I may soar as high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I can now discern with this clear eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That my weak hand may equal my firm faith,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my life practice more than my tongue saith;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">That my low conduct may not show,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Nor my relenting lines,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">That I thy purpose did not know,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Or overrated thy designs."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And it may be said of him that he acted
this prayer as well as uttered it. Says Channing
again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In our estimate of his character, the moral
qualities form the basis; for himself rigidly enjoined;
if in another, he could overlook delinquency.
Truth before all things; in all your
thoughts, your faintest breath, the austerest purity,
the utmost fulfilling of the interior law; faith in
friends, and an iron and flinty pursuit of right,
which nothing can tease or purchase out of us."</p></div>

<p>Thus it is said that when he went to
prison rather than pay his tax, which went
to support slavery in South Carolina, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
his friend Emerson came to the cell and
said, "Henry, why are you here?" the reply
was, "Why are you <em>not</em> here?"</p>

<p>In this act, which even his best friends
at first denounced as "mean and sneaking
and in bad taste,"&mdash;this refusal to pay the
trifling sum demanded of him by the Concord
tax-gatherer,&mdash;the outlines of his
political philosophy appear. They were
illuminated afterwards by his trenchant utterances
in denunciation of slavery and in
encomium of John Brown, who attacked
that monster in its most vulnerable part.
It was not mere whim, but a settled theory
of human nature and the institution of
government, which led him, in 1838, to renounce
the parish church and refuse to pay
its tax, in 1846 to renounce the State and
refuse tribute to it, and in 1859 to come forward,
first of all men, in public support of
Brown and his Virginia campaign. This
theory found frequent expression in his
lectures. In 1846 he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Any man more right than his neighbors constitutes
a majority of one already."</p></div>

<p>And again:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I know this well, that if one thousand, if one
hundred, if ten men whom I could name,&mdash;if
ten <em>honest</em> men only,&mdash;ay, if one honest man,
<em>ceasing to hold slaves</em>, were actually to withdraw
from this copartnership, and be locked up in the
county jail therefor, it would be the abolition of
slavery in America. Under a government which
imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a just
man is also a prison."</p></div>

<p>This sounded hollow then, but when that
embodiment of American justice and mercy,
John Brown, lay bleeding in a Virginia
prison, a dozen years later, the significance
of Thoreau's words began to be seen; and
when a few years after our countrymen
were dying by hundreds of thousands to
complete what Brown, with his single life,
had begun, the whole truth, as Thoreau
had seen it, flashed in the eyes of the nation.</p>

<p>In this same essay of 1846, on "Civil
Disobedience," the ultimate truth concerning
government is stated in a passage which
also does justice to Daniel Webster, our
"logic-fencer and parliamentary Hercules,"
as Carlyle called him in a letter to Emerson
in 1839. Thoreau said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Statesmen and legislators, standing so completely
within the institution (of government)
never distinctly and nakedly behold it. They
speak of moving society, but have no resting-place
without it. They are wont to forget that
the world is not governed by policy and expediency.
Webster never goes behind government,
and so cannot speak with authority about it. His
words are wisdom to those legislators who contemplate
no essential reform in the existing government;
but for thinkers, and those who legislate
for all time, he never once glances at the
subject. Yet compared with the cheap professions
of most reformers, and the still cheaper wisdom
and eloquence of politicians in general, his are
almost the only sensible and valuable words, and
we thank heaven for him. Comparatively, he is
always strong, original, and, above all, practical;
still his quality is not wisdom, but prudence.
Truth is always in harmony with herself, and is
not concerned chiefly to reveal the justice that
may consist with wrong-doing. For eighteen
hundred years the New Testament has been
written; yet where is the legislator who has wisdom
and practical talent enough to avail himself
of the light which it sheds on the science of government?"</p></div>

<p>Such a legislator, proclaiming his law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
from the scaffold, at last appeared in John
Brown:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I see a book kissed here which I suppose to
be the Bible, or at least the New Testament.
That teaches me that 'whatsoever I would that
men should do unto me, I should do even so to
them.' It teaches me further to 'remember
them that are in bonds as bound with them.' I
endeavored to act up to that instruction. I say
that I am yet too young to understand that God
is any respecter of persons. I believe that, to have
interfered as I have done in behalf of His despised
poor, was not wrong, but right."</p></div>

<p>Before these simple words of Brown,
down went Webster and all his industry in
behalf of the "compromises of the Constitution."
When Thoreau heard them, and
saw the matchless behavior of his noble
old friend, he recognized the hour and the
man.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"For once," he cried in the church-vestry at
Concord, "we are lifted into the region of truth
and manhood. No man, in America, has ever
stood up so persistently and effectively for the
dignity of human nature; knowing himself for a
man, and the equal of any and all governments.
The only government that I recognize,&mdash;and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
matters not how few are at the head of it, or how
small its army,&mdash;is that power which establishes
justice in the land."</p></div>

<p>Words like these have proved immortal
when spoken in the cell of Socrates, and
they lose none of their vitality, coming from
the Concord philosopher.</p>

<p>The weakness of Webster was in his
moral principles; he could not resist temptation;
could not keep out of debt; could
not avoid those obligations which the admiration
or the selfishness of his friends forced
upon him, and which left him, in his old
age, neither independence nor gratitude.
Thoreau's strength was in his moral nature,
and in his obstinate refusal to mortgage
himself, his time, or his opinions, even to
the State or the Church. The haughtiness of
his independence kept him from a thousand
temptations that beset men of less courage
and self-denial.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a><br /><br />

LIFE, DEATH, AND IMMORTALITY.</h2>


<p>The life of Thoreau naturally divides
itself into three parts: his Apprenticeship,
from birth to the summer of 1837, when he
left Harvard College; his Journey-work
(Wanderjahre) from 1837 to 1849, when
he appeared as an author, with his first
book; and his Mastership,&mdash;not of a college,
a merchantman, or a mechanic art,
but of the trade and mystery of writing.
He had aspired to live and study and practice,
so that he could write&mdash;to use his own
words&mdash;"sentences which suggest far more
than they say, which have an atmosphere
about them, which do not report an old, but
make a new impression." To frame such
sentences as these, he said, "as durable as a
Roman aqueduct," was the art of writing
coveted by him; "sentences which are expressive,
towards which so many volumes,
so much life went; which lie like boulders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
on the page, up and down or across,&mdash;not
mere repetition, but creation, and which a
man might sell his ground or cattle to
build." It was this thirst for final and concentrated
expression, and not love of fame,
or "literary aspirations," as poor Greeley
put it, which urged him on to write. For
printing he cared little,&mdash;and few authors
since Shakespeare have been less anxious to
publish what they wrote. Of the seven volumes
of his works first printed, and twenty
more which may be published some day,
only two, "The Week" and "Walden,"
appeared in his lifetime,&mdash;though the material
for two more had been scattered
about in forgotten magazines and newspapers,
for his friends to collect after his
death. Of his first works (and some of his
best) it could be said, as Thomas Wharton
said, in 1781, of his friend Gray's verses,
"I yet reflect with pain upon the cool reception
which those noble odes, 'The Progress
of Poetry' and 'The Bard' met with
at their first publication; it appeared there
were not twenty people in England who
liked them." This disturbed Thoreau's
friends, but not himself; he rather rejoiced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
in the slow sale of his first book; and when
the balance of the edition,&mdash;more than seven
hundred copies out of one thousand,&mdash;came
back upon his hands unsold in 1855, and
earlier, he told me with glee that he had
made an addition of seven hundred volumes
to his library, and all of his own
composition. "O solitude, obscurity, meanness!"
he exclaims in 1856 to his friend
Blake, "I never triumph so as when I have
the least success in my neighbors' eyes."
Of course, pride had something to do with
this; "it was a wild stock of pride," as
Burke said of Lord Keppel, "on which the
tenderest of all hearts had grafted the
milder virtues." Both pride and piety led
him to write,&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Though often ranked as an unbeliever,
and too scornful in some of his expressions
concerning the religion of other men, Thoreau
was in truth deeply religious. Sincerity
and devotion were his most marked
traits; and both are seen in his verses from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
the same poem ("Inspiration") so often
quoted:&mdash;</p>

<p>Thoreau's business in life was observation,
thought, and writing, to which last,
reading was essential. He read much, but
studied more; nor was his reading that indiscriminate,
miscellaneous perusal of everything
printed, which has become the vice of
this age. He read books of travel, scientific
books, authors of original merit, but few
newspapers, of which he had a very poor
opinion. "Read not the 'Times,' read the
Eternities," he said. Nor did he admire
the magazines, or their editors, greatly. He
quarreled with "Putnam's Magazine," in
1853-54, and in 1858, after yielding to the
suggestion of Mr. Emerson, that he should
contribute to the "Atlantic," in consequence
of a dispute with Mr. Lowell, its editor,
about the omission of a sentence in one of
his articles, he published no more in that
magazine until the year of his death (1862),
when Mr. Fields obtained from him some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
his choicest manuscripts. He spent the last
months of his life in revising these, and
they continued to appear for some years
after his death. Those which were published
in the "Atlantic" in 1878 are passages from
his journals, selected by his friend Blake,
who long had the custody of his manuscripts.
These consist chiefly of his journals
in thirty-nine volumes, many parts of which
had already been printed, either by Thoreau
himself, by his sister Sophia, or his friend
Channing, who, in 1873, published a life
of Thoreau, containing many extracts from
the journals, which had never before been
printed. When we speak of his works, we
should include Mr. Channing's book also,
half of which, at least, is from Thoreau's
pen.</p>

<p>His method in writing was peculiarly his
own, though it bore some external resemblance
to that of his friends, Emerson and
Alcott. Like them he early began to keep
a journal, which became both diary and
commonplace book. But while they noted
down the thoughts which occurred to them,
without premeditation or consecutive arrangement,
Thoreau made studies and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span> observations
for his journal as carefully and
habitually as he noted the angles and distances
in surveying a Concord farm. In
all his daily walks and distant journeys, he
took notes on the spot of what occurred to
him, and these, often very brief and symbolic,
he carefully wrote out, as soon as he
could get time, in his diary, not classified
by topics, but just as they had come to him.
To these he added his daily meditations,
sometimes expressed in verse, especially in
the years between 1837 and 1850, but generally
in close and pertinent prose. Many
details are found in his diaries, but not
such as are common in the diaries of other
men,&mdash;not trivial but significant details.
From these daily entries he made up his
essays, his lectures, and his volumes; all being
slowly, and with much deliberation and
revision, brought into the form in which he
gave them to the public. After that he
scarcely changed them at all; they had
received the last imprint of his mind, and
he allowed them to stand and speak for
themselves. But before printing, they underwent
constant change, by addition, erasure,
transposition, correction, and combination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
A given lecture might be two years,
or twenty years in preparation; or it might
be, like his defense of John Brown, copied
with little change from the pages of his
diary for the fortnight previous. But that
was an exceptional case; and Thoreau was
stirred and quickened by the campaign and
capture of Brown, as perhaps he had never
been before.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The thought of that man's position and fate,"
he said, "is spoiling many a man's day here at
the North for other thinking. If any one who
has seen John Brown in Concord, can pursue
successfully any other train of thought, I do not
know what he is made of. If there is any such
who gets his usual allowance of sleep, I will
warrant him to fatten easily under any circumstances
which do not touch his body or purse. I
put a piece of paper and a pencil under my pillow,
and when I could not sleep, I wrote in the
dark. I was so absorbed in him as to be surprised
whenever I detected the routine of the
natural world surviving still, or met persons going
about their affairs indifferent."</p></div>

<p>The fact that Thoreau noted down his
thoughts by night as well as by day, appears
also from an entry in one of his journals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
where he is describing the coming on
of day, as witnessed by him at the close of
a September night in Concord. "Some
bird flies over," he writes, "making a noise
like the barking of a puppy (it was a
cuckoo). It is yet so dark that I have
dropped my pencil and cannot find it." No
writer of modern times, in fact, was so much
awake and abroad at night, or has described
better the phenomena of darkness and of
moonlight.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note some dates and
incidents concerning a few of Thoreau's
essays. The celebrated chapter on "Friendship,"
in the "Week," was written in the
winter of 1847-48, soon after he left Walden,
and while he was a member of Mr. Emerson's
household during the absence of his
friend in Europe. On the 13th of January,
1848, Mr. Alcott notes in his diary:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Henry Thoreau came in after my hours with
the children, and we had a good deal of talk on
the modes of popular influence. He read me a
manuscript essay of his on 'Friendship,' which
he has just written, and which I thought superior
to anything I had heard."</p></div>

<p>To the same period or a little later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span> belong
those verses called "The Departure,"
which declare, under a similitude, Thoreau's
relations with one family of his friends.</p>

<p>In 1843, when he first met Henry James,
Lucretia Mott, and others who have since
been famous, in the pleasant seclusion of
Staten Island, he wrote a translation of the
"Seven Against Thebes," which has never
been printed, some translations from Pindar,
printed in the "Dial," in 1844, and two articles
for the New York "Democratic Review,"
called "Paradise to be Regained,"
and "The Landlord."</p>

<p>Thoreau left "a vast amount of manuscript,"
in the words of his sister, who was
his literary executor until her death in
1876, when she committed her trust to his
Worcester friend, Mr. Harrison Blake.
She was aided in the revision and publication
of the "Excursions," "Maine Woods,"
"Letters," and other volumes which she
issued from 1862 to 1866, by Mr. Emerson,
Mr. Channing, and other friends,&mdash;Mr.
Emerson having undertaken that selection
of letters and poems from his mass of correspondence
and his preserved verses, which
appeared in 1865. His purpose, as he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
to Miss Thoreau, was to exhibit in that volume
"a most perfect piece of stoicism,"
and he fancied that she had "marred his
classic statue" by inserting some tokens of
natural affection which the domestic letters
showed. Miss Thoreau said that "it did
not seem quite honest to Henry" to leave
out such passages; Mr. Fields, the publisher,
agreed with her, and a few of them
were retained. His correspondence, as a
whole, is much more affectionate, and less
pugnacious than would appear from the
published volume. He was fond of dispute,
but those who knew him best loved him
most.</p>

<p>Of his last illness his sister said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It was not possible to be sad in his presence.
No shadow of gloom attaches to anything in my
mind connected with my precious brother. He
has done much to strengthen the faith of his
friends. Henry's whole life impresses me as a
grand miracle."</p></div>

<p>Walking once with Mr. Alcott, soon after
he passed his eightieth birth day, as we
faced the lovely western sky in December,
the old Pythagorean said, "I always think
of Thoreau when I look at a sunset;" and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
I then remembered it was at that hour Thoreau
usually walked along the village street,
under the arch of trees, with the sunset sky
seen through their branches. "He said to
me in his last illness," added Alcott, "'I
shall leave the world without a regret,'&mdash;that
was the saying either of a grand egotist
or of a deeply religious soul." Thoreau was
both, and both his egotism and his devotion
offended many of those who met him.
His aversion to the companionship of men
was partly religious&mdash;a fondness for the inward
life&mdash;and partly egotism and scorn
for frivolity.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Emerson says his life is so unprofitable and
shabby for the most part," writes Thoreau in
1854, "that he is driven to all sorts of resources,&mdash;and
among the rest to men. I tell him we
differ only in our resources: mine is to get away
from men. They very rarely affect me as grand
or beautiful; but I know that there is a sunrise
and a sunset every day. I have seen more men
than usual lately; and well as I was acquainted
with one, I am surprised to find what vulgar fellows
they are."</p></div>

<p>In 1859 he wrote to Mr. Blake:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have lately got back to that glorious society
called Solitude, where we meet our friends
continually, and can imagine the outside world
also to be peopled. Yet some of my acquaintance
would fain hustle me into the almshouse
for <em>the sake of society</em>; as if I were pining for that
diet, when I seem to myself a most befriended
man, and find constant employment. However,
they do not believe a word I say. They have
got a club, the handle of which is in the Parker
House, at Boston, and with this they beat me
from time to time, expecting to make me tender,
or minced meat, and so fit for a club to dine off.
The doctors are all agreed that I am suffering
for want of society. Was never a case like it!
First, I did not know that I was suffering at all.
Secondly, as an Irishman might say, I had thought
it was indigestion of the society I got."</p></div>

<p>Yet Thoreau knew the value of society,
and avoided it oftentimes only because he
was too busy. To his friend Ricketson,
who reproached him for ceasing to answer
letters, he wrote in November, 1860, just
before he took the fatal cold that terminated
in consumption and ended his life
prematurely:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Friend Ricketson</span>,&mdash;You know that I
never promised to correspond with you, and so,
when I do, I do more than I promised. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
are my pursuits and habits, that I rarely go
abroad; and it is quite a habit with me to decline
invitations to do so. Not that I could not
enjoy such visits, if I were not otherwise occupied.
I have enjoyed very much my visits to
you, and my rides in your neighborhood, and am
sorry that I cannot enjoy such things oftener;
but life is short, and there are other things also
to be done. I admit that you are more social
than I am, and more attentive to 'the common
courtesies of life;' but this is partly for the reason
that you have fewer or less exacting private
pursuits. Not to have written a note for a year
is with me a very venial offense. I think I do
not correspond with any one so often as once in
six months. I have a faint recollection of your
invitation referred to; but I suppose I had no
new or particular reason for declining, and so
made no new statement. I have felt that you
would be glad to see me almost whenever I got
ready to come; but I only offer myself as a rare
visitor, and a still rarer correspondent. I am very
busy, after my fashion, little as there is to show
for it, and feel as if I could not spend many days
nor dollars in traveling; for the shortest visit must
have a fair margin to it, and the days thus affect
the weeks, you know.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, we cannot forego these luxuries
altogether. Please remember me to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
family. I have a very pleasant recollection of
your fireside, and I trust that I shall revisit it;
also of your shanty and the surrounding regions."</p></div>

<p>He did make a last visit to this friend in
August, 1861, after his return from Minnesota,
whither he went with young Horace
Mann, in June. And it was to Mr. Ricketson
that Sophia Thoreau, two weeks after
her brother's death, wrote the following account
of his last illness:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="datesig">
"<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, <em>May 20, 1862</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;Profound joy mingles with
my grief. I feel as if something very beautiful
had happened,&mdash;not death. Although Henry is
with us no longer, yet the memory of his sweet
and virtuous soul must ever cheer and comfort
me. My heart is filled with praise to God for
the gift of such a brother, and may I never distrust
the love and wisdom of Him who made him,
and who has now called him to labor in more glorious
fields than earth affords!</p>

<p>"You ask for some particulars relating to
Henry's illness. I feel like saying that Henry
was never affected, never reached by it. I never
before saw such a manifestation of the power of
spirit over matter. Very often I have heard him
tell his visitors that he enjoyed existence as well
as ever. He remarked to me that there was as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
much comfort in perfect disease as in perfect
health, the mind always conforming to the condition
of the body. The thought of death, he
said, could not begin to trouble him. His
thoughts had entertained him all his life, and
did still. When he had wakeful nights, he
would ask me to arrange the furniture, so as to
make fantastic shadows on the wall, and he
wished his bed was in the form of a shell that he
might curl up in it. He considered occupation
as necessary for the sick as for those in health,
and has accomplished a vast amount of labor during
the past few months, in preparing some papers
for the press. He did not cease to call for
his manuscript till the last day of his life. During
his long illness I never heard a murmur escape
him, or the slightest wish expressed to
remain with us. His perfect contentment was
truly wonderful. None of his friends seemed to
realize how very ill he was, so full of life and
good cheer did he seem. One friend, as if by
way of consolation, said to him, 'Well, Mr. Thoreau,
we must all go.' Henry replied, 'When I
was a very little boy, I learned that I must die,
and I set that down, so, of course, I am not
disappointed now. Death is as near to you as it
is to me.'</p>

<p>"There is very much that I should like to
write you about my precious brother had I time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
and strength. I wish you to know how very
gentle, lovely, and submissive he was in all his
ways. His little study bed was brought down
into our front parlor, when he could no longer
walk with our assistance, and every arrangement
pleased him. The devotion of his friends was
most rare and touching. His room was made fragrant
by the gifts of flowers from young and old.
Fruit of every kind which the season afforded,
and game of all sorts, were sent him. It was
really pathetic, the way in which the town was
moved to minister to his comfort. Total strangers
sent grateful messages, remembering the good he
had done them. All this attention was fully appreciated
and very gratifying to Henry. He would
sometimes say, 'I should be ashamed to stay in
this world after so much has been done for me.
I could never repay my friends.' And they remembered
him to the last. Only about two hours
before he left us, Judge Hoar called with a bouquet
of hyacinths fresh from his garden, which
Henry smelt and said he liked, and a few minutes
after he was gone another friend came with
a dish of his favorite jelly. I can never be grateful
enough for the gentle, easy exit which was
granted him. At seven o'clock, Tuesday morning,
he became restless, and desired to be moved.
Dear Mother, aunt Louisa, and myself were with
him. His self-possession did not forsake him. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
little after eight he asked to be raised quite up.
His breathing grew fainter and fainter, and without
the slightest struggle, he left us at nine
o'clock,&mdash;but not alone; our Heavenly Father
was with us.</p>

<p>"Your last letter reached us by the evening
mail on Monday. Henry asked me to read it to
him, which I did. He enjoyed your letters, and
felt disappointed not to see you again. Mr.
Blake and Mr. Brown came twice to visit him,
since January. They were present at his funeral,
which took place in the church. Mr. Emerson
read such an address as no other man could have
done. It is a source of great satisfaction that one
so gifted knew and loved my brother, and is prepared
to speak such brave words about him at
this time. The 'Atlantic Monthly' for July will
contain Mr. Emerson's memories of Henry. I
hope that you saw a notice of the services on
Friday, written by Mr. Fields, in the 'Transcript.'</p>

<p>"Let me thank you for your very friendly letters.
I trust we shall see you in Concord, Anniversary
Week. It would give me pleasure to
make the acquaintance of your family, of whom
my brother has so often told me. If convenient,
will you please bring the ambrotype of Henry
which was taken last autumn in New Bedford.
I am interested to see it. Mr. Channing will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
take the crayon likeness to Boston this week to
secure some photographs. My intention was to
apologize for not writing you at this time; but
I must now trust to your generosity to pardon
this hasty letter, written under a great pressure
of cares and amidst frequent interruptions. My
mother unites with me in very kind regards to
your family.</p>

<p>To Parker Pillsbury, who would fain talk
with Thoreau in this last winter concerning
the next world, the reply was, "One world
at a time." To a young friend (Myron
Benton) he wrote a few weeks before
death:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="datesig">"<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, <em>March 21, 1862</em>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I thank you for your very
kind letter, which, ever since I received it, I
have intended to answer before I died, however
briefly. I am encouraged to know, that, so
far as you are concerned, I have not written my
books in vain. I was particularly gratified, some
years ago, when one of my friends and neighbors
said, 'I wish you would write another book&mdash;write
it for me.' He is actually more familiar
with what I have written than I am myself.
I am pleased when you say that in 'The
Week' you like especially 'those little snatches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
of poetry interspersed through the book;' for
these, I suppose, are the least attractive to most
readers. I have not been engaged in any particular
work on Botany, or the like, though, if I
were to live, I should have much to report on
Natural History generally.</p>

<p>"You ask particularly after my health. I
<em>suppose</em> that I have not many months to live;
but, of course, I know nothing about it. I may
add, that I am enjoying existence as much as
ever, and regret nothing.</p>

<p>"With an unfaltering trust in God's
mercies," wrote Ellery Channing, "and
never deserted by his good genius, he most
bravely and unsparingly passed down the
inclined plane of a terrible malady&mdash;pulmonary
consumption; working steadily at
the completing of his papers to his last
hours, or so long as he could hold the pencil
in his trembling fingers. Yet if he did get
a little sleep to comfort him in this year's
campaign of sleepless affliction, he was sure
to interest those about him in his singular
dreams, more than usually fantastic. He
said once, that having got a few moments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
of repose, 'sleep seemed to hang round his
bed in festoons.' He declared uniformly
that he preferred to endure with a clear
mind the worst penalties of suffering rather
than be plunged in a turbid dream by narcotics.
His patience was unfailing; assuredly
he knew not aught save resignation;
he did mightily cheer and console those
whose strength was less. His every instant
now, his least thought and work, sacredly
belonged to them, dearer than his rapidly
perishing life, whom he should so quickly
leave behind."</p>

<p>Once or twice he shed tears. Upon hearing
a wandering musician in the street
playing some tune of his childhood he
might never hear again, he wept, and said
to his mother, "Give him some money for
me!"</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Northward he turneth through a little door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scarce three steps, ere Music's golden tongue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flattered to tears this aged man and poor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no&mdash;already had his death-bell rung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The joys of all his life were said and sung."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>He died on the 6th of May, 1862, and
had a public funeral from the parish church
a few days later. On his coffin his friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
Channing placed several inscriptions, among
them this, "Hail to thee, O man! who hast
come from the transitory place to the imperishable."
This sentiment may stand as
faintly marking Thoreau's deep, vital conviction
of immortality, of which he never
had entertained a doubt in his life. There
was in his view of the world and its Maker
no room for doubt; so that when he was
once asked, superfluously, what he thought
of a future world and its compensations, he
replied, "Those were voluntaries I did not
take,"&mdash;having confined himself to the
foreordained course of things. He is buried
in the village cemetery, quaintly named
"Sleepy Hollow," with his family and
friends about him; one of whom, surviving
him for a few years, said, as she looked
upon his low head-stone on the hillside,
"Concord is Henry's monument, covered
with suitable inscriptions by his own
hand."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> <em>Emerson's Sketch of Dr. Ripley.</em> Hood, in his <em>Music
for the Million</em>, describes an angry man as slamming a
door "with a <em>wooden damn</em>."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> At the date of this letter Dr. Ripley was not quite
eighty-two, and he lived to be more than ninety. Mr.
Alcott, who has now passed the age of eighty-two, has
been for years doing in some degree what Dr. Channing
urged the patriarch of his denomination to do, but which
the old minister never found time and strength for. It
is curious that these two venerable men, whose united
life in Concord covers a period of more than a century,
both came from Connecticut.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> This princely anecdote is paralleled, in its way, by
one told of Gershom Bradford, of Duxbury, son of Colonel
Gam. Bradford, the friend of Washington and Kosciusko,
but himself a plain Old Colony farmer. Once
walking in his woods, he saw a man cutting down a fine
tree; he concealed himself that the man might not see
him, and went home. When asked why he did not stop
the trespasser, he replied, "Could not the poor man have
a tree?" Gershom Bradford was a descendant of Governor
Bradford, the Pilgrim, and uncle of Mrs. Sarah
Ripley, of Concord.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> This would, of course, diminish his own share, as
the law then stood, from one half the estate to one fourth,
or less.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> "These facts," says his biographer, whom I knew
well, "show clearly, I think, not only that his love of
right was stronger than his love of money, but that he
would rather make any sacrifice of property than leave
a doubt in his own mind whether justice had been done
to others."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> <a id="Lucy"></a>Lucy Barnes, daughter of Jonathan and Rachel
Barnes of Marlborough, was born July 7, 1742, married
Joseph Hosmer, of Concord, December 24, 1761, and
died in Concord, &mdash;&mdash;, &mdash;&mdash;. Her brother was Rev.
Jonathan Barnes, born in 1749, graduated at Harvard
College, in 1770, and settled as a minister in Hillsborough,
N. H., where he died in 1805.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> The resemblance between some of John Woolman's
utterances and those of Henry Thoreau has been noticed
by Whittier, who says of the New Jersey Quaker, "From
his little farm on the Rancocas he looked out with a
mingled feeling of wonder and sorrow upon the hurry
and unrest of the world; he regarded the merely rich man
with unfeigned pity. With nothing of his scorn, he had
all of Thoreau's commiseration for people who went
about, bowed down with the weight of broad acres and
great houses on their backs." The "scorn" of Thoreau
and the "pity," of Woolman, sprang from a common
root, however.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> In building this quaint structure, Thoreau was so
averse to Mr. Alcott's plan of putting up and tearing down
with no settled design of form on paper, that he withdrew
his mechanic hand, so skillful in all carpenter work.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

now paid. As the letter courteously states some matters
that have now become curious, it may be given:&mdash;

"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have read the articles of Mr. Thoreau
forwarded by you, and will be glad to publish them
if our terms are satisfactory. We generally pay for
prose composition per printed page, and would allow
him three dollars per page. We do not pay more than
four dollars for any that we now engage. I did not
suppose our maximum rate would have paid you (Mr.
Greeley) for your lecture, and therefore requested to
know your own terms. Of course, when an article is
unusually desirable, we may deviate from rule; I now
only mention ordinary arrangement. I was very sorry
not to have your article, but shall enjoy the reading of it
in Graham. Mr. T. might send us some further contributions,
and shall at least receive prompt and courteous
decision respecting them. Yours truly,

<p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Thoreau says of this adventure: "After putting our

to build a substantial house. This was done about dark,
and by that time we were as wet as if we had stood in a
hogshead of water. We then built a fire before the door,
directly on the site of our camp of two years ago. Standing
before this, and turning round slowly, like meat that
is roasting, we were as dry, if not drier than ever, after
a few hours, and so, at last, we turned in."</p></div>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
